# Spain: Barcelona: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas. Institucion Mila y Fontanals. DCH-Musicologia

**New electronic resource: Map of Musical Heritage in Spain**

The Music and Dance Documentation Center of the Ministry of Culture of Spain, with the help of AEDOM, the Spanish Branch of IAML (Project AMA) and RISM-Spain, presented last November a map of 350 Spanish public institutions (archives, libraries, and documentation centres) that hold fonds and heritage collections related to music (musical manuscripts, sound recordings and instrument collections).

The information included is a short history of the institution, list of specific fonds as well as a specific bibliography for each institution.

The map can be found here: [http://musicadanza.es/mapatrimoniomusical/](http://musicadanza.es/mapatrimoniomusical/){:blank}

A short description from the National Library of Spain is available [here](http://musicadanza.es/mapatrimoniomusical/localizacion/?id=115&b=&todos=5&archivos=&bibliotecas=&centros=&museos=&zoom=17&center=40.424919892334906,-3.6908158562209747){:blank}.

**Book Reviews  
by Antonio Ezquerro**

**Bernardo García-Bernalt Alonso: _Catálogo del Archivo de Música de la Capilla de la Universidad de Salamanca._ Salamanca: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca, col. “VIII Centenario, 7”, 2013. 957pp.**  **€9.99. ISBN: 978-84-9012-282-2.**

This work was carried out by the director of the Academy of Ancient Music from the Cultural Activities Service at the University of Salamanca, who has promoted the documentary cataloging of the music holdings of the chapel of the university, which was active during the period 1738-1801. At that time, the Salamanca _Studium Generale_ had at will, in order to solemnize their academic activities of a ceremonial and ritual kind, a stable music chapel provided with a chapelmaster plus twelve musicians (organist and harpist, two altos, two tenors, two violins, shawm, dulcian, and three choirboys), generating the archive now being analyzed.

Moreover, as is well known, the relationship of the prestigious University of Salamanca (one of the oldest in Europe) with music goes back to when it was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso X the Wise. Interestingly, the year 2013 marks the fifth centenary of the birth of the famous university teacher (and its most important musician) Francisco de Salinas. But the documentary holdings of music that concern us here in particular, belonging to the Real Capilla de San Jerónimo, stand out as the one of “the largest and most Catholic of the Kingdom’s oldest university” in the historical period in which it was in operation, from 1738 (with the teaching of Antonio Yanguas) until 1801 (under the direction of his last maestro de capilla, Bernardo del Manzano).

The catalog, made accurately and fairly thorough, has largely followed RISM guidelines for cataloging data, known in its present version in Spanish as _RISM. Normas Internacionales para la catalogación de Fuentes Musicales Históricas_ (Madrid: Arco/Libros, 1996).

The contents of the publication are organized around two main themes, the first dedicated to polyphony and instrumental music, and second, conceived as an addendum, to plainchant. It also offers a substantial introduction in which the origin, development and significance of the holdings are contextualized, appendices with some historical inventories and partial listings are provided, and a good bibliography is added at the end of work. It incorporates useful indexes, not only about polyphonic music (by author, title, textual incipits, offering correspondence of signatures, matches, different dedications, references to scribes, etc.), but also Gregorian chant (general index, alphabetical, textual incipits, for invocations, etc.). In short, an excellent job, it will definitely be useful to give more visibility to the documentary collections of a prominent Spanish musical chapel.

**José López-Calo, S.J.: La música en las catedrales españolas (Music in Spanish Cathedrals). Música Hispana. Textos. Estudios. Madrid: Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales, 2012. 719p. €40.00. ISBN: 978-84-89457-48-5.**

With a title as large and ambitious as the one that heads this publication (the recent Cathedral National Plan recorded no fewer than 96 cathedrals in Spain today, where music has been cultivated for over a thousand years), the Jesuit Father Jose Lopez-Calo (\*1922), professor emeritus at the University of Santiago de Compostela and one of the leaders of twentieth century pan-Hispanic musicology, summarizes the work and career that has occupied him throughout a long life.

Involved from an early age in the zeal for historical and musical Spanish heritage, he was one of the most active RISM contributors, from the time when this international project was based in Kassel.

This book, which constitutes in a way a synthesis of his extensive musicological work and dedication, seeks to reconstruct the history of the presence, meaning, and importance of music in Spanish cathedrals. Furthermore, he tries to do it "from within", trying to situate both himself and his readers in the thoughts that moved the cathedral authorities and their musicians, in terms of both the creation and the use of music over the centuries.

Furthermore, efforts have been made to add a new point of view to the focus that is usually given to this type of work in respect to the human element, a novel factor, focusing the interest of the study on the music itself, that is, on its internal development, which has resulted in a profuse incorporation of musical examples.
