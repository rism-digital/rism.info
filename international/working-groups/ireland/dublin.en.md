The Research Foundation for Music in Ireland is delighted to announce the launch of a new free-  
to-access online resource detailing the _who_, _what_, _where_ and _when_ of the historic music trade in   
Dublin.

The Dublin Music Trade project was initiated by the late Brian Boydell (1917–2000): composer,   
professor of music at Trinity College Dublin and author of the seminal texts _A Dublin Musical   
Calendar, 1700–60_ (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1988) and_Rotunda Music in Eighteenth-  
Century Dublin_ (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1992). Over the course of his research, he   
compiled a card index of music publishers, printers, sellers and instrument makers in Dublin   
from 1750 to 1850. Publication of this research was planned but never came to fruition.  
In the 1990s this research was passed onto his son Barra Boydell: professor of music at the   
National University of Ireland, Maynooth and expert on the history of music in Ireland with   
an emphasis on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and on organology and musical   
iconography. Barra transferred the information from his father’s card catalogue to computer.   
He developed and expanded the database, planning to extend the research to the end of the   
nineteenth century. On his retirement in 2010, Barra passed the research onto Dr Catherine Ferris   
to develop into an online resource.

While access to the Boydell's research was restricted to those in personal contact with the   
family, it became a key reference for musicologists, historians, music librarians and archival   
scholars, particularly for establishing unknown publication dates of scores by cross-referencing   
dates and addresses of publishers. In bringing the Boydell's research online with the launch of   
[DublinMusicTrade.ie](http://www.dublinmusictrade.ie/){:blank}, access to this valuable information is now freely-accessible and fully-  
searchable.

While the coverage falls primarily between 1515 and 1850, this is only the first step in bringing   
together information on the music trade in Dublin from the earliest times to the present day.  
The editors invite contributions to expand and develop the Dublin Music Trade resource. Details   
on businesses or surviving instruments/published music are particularly welcome. Post-graduate   
and post-doctoral research projects on the any aspect of the music trade in Dublin are also   
encouraged.

The Dublin Music Trade has been funded by the [Music Libraries Trust](http://www.iaml.info/iaml-uk-irl/mlt/){:blank} and the [Society for   
Musicology in Ireland](http://www.musicologyireland.com/){:blank}. It is hosted by the [Research Foundation for Music in Ireland](http://musicresearch.ie/){:blank} and is   
supported by the [Conservatory of Music & Drama at the Dublin Institute of Technology](http://www.dit.ie/conservatory/){:blank}.
