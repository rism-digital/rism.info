# Ireland

**Ongoing projects:**

**_Mercer’s Hospital Music Collection: Tríona O’Hanlon, Dublin Institute of Technology_**

This project involves cataloguing the contents of the Mercer’s Hospital Music Collection, currently housed at the Manuscripts’ Department at Trinity College Dublin, and constitutes a central part of O’Hanlon’s doctoral thesis, _Music for Mercer’s: The Mercer’s Hospital Music Collection and charity music in eighteenth-century Dublin_. The contents of the collection reveal significant information regarding eighteenth-century Dublin repertoire, adaptations and revisions made to several parts in the collection afford insight into eighteenth-century Dublin performance practice issues and the identification of Mercer’s paper types and copyists enhances knowledge of the various paper types available in eighteenth-century Dublin, eighteenth-century Dublin copyists, the activity of copying and how music was collated and stored. The collection’s provenance and relationship to extant collections in the British Isles is also significant.

The Mercer’s Hospital Music Collection catalogue records are currently being processed and are expected to be published online in the Irish RISM database in early 2012.



**_Music in the Irish Country House: Dr Karol Mullaney-Dignam, National University of Ireland Maynooth_**

The objectives of this ongoing interdisciplinary research project are to identify and catalogue the music collections of selected country houses in Ireland; to interpret the historical context within which these collections were assembled, utilised and maintained by the Irish landed elite in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries; to create knowledge of and digital access to these primary sources, particularly through the RISM; to work to preserve, interpret and present these sources for public consumption in collaboration with current house owners and custodians.

To date, project outputs have included academic conference and seminar papers, public lectures and publications, such as _Music and dancing at Castletown, Co. Kildare, 1759-1821_ (Dublin, 2011).

This project is funded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities & Social Sciences.

## New publications: Launch of the Dublin Music Trade

http://www.dublinmusictrade.ie The Research Foundation for Music in Ireland is delighted to announce the launch of a new free-to-access online resource detailing the who, what, where and when of the historic music trade in Dublin. The Dublin Music Trade project was initiated by the late Brian Boydell (1917–2000): composer,
professor of music at Trinity College Dublin and author of the seminal texts A Dublin Musical
Calendar, 1700–60 (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1988) and Rotunda Music in Eighteenth-
Century Dublin (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1992). Over the course of his research, he
compiled a card index of music publishers, printers, sellers and instrument makers in Dublin
from 1750 to 1850. Publication of this research was planned but never came to fruition.
In the 1990s this research was passed onto his son Barra Boydell: professor of music at the
National University of Ireland, Maynooth and expert on the history of music in Ireland with
an emphasis on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and on organology and musical
iconography. Barra transferred the information from his father’s card catalogue to computer.
He developed and expanded the database, planning to extend the research to the end of the
nineteenth century. On his retirement in 2010, Barra passed the research onto Dr Catherine Ferris
to develop into an online resource.


While access to the Boydell's research was restricted to those in personal contact with the
family, it became a key reference for musicologists, historians, music librarians and archival
scholars, particularly for establishing unknown publication dates of scores by cross-referencing
dates and addresses of publishers. In bringing the Boydell's research online with the launch of
DublinMusicTrade.ie, access to this valuable information is now freely-accessible and fully-
searchable.


While the coverage falls primarily between 1515 and 1850, this is only the first step in bringing
together information on the music trade in Dublin from the earliest times to the present day.
The editors invite contributions to expand and develop the Dublin Music Trade resource. Details
on businesses or surviving instruments/published music are particularly welcome. Post-graduate
and post-doctoral research projects on the any aspect of the music trade in Dublin are also
encouraged.


The Dublin Music Trade has been funded by the Music Libraries Trust and the Society for
Musicology in Ireland. It is hosted by the Research Foundation for Music in Ireland and is
supported by the Conservatory of Music & Drama at the Dublin Institute of Technology.
