# Mexico: Dr. John G. Lazos

RISM-Lazos\_Mexican music/Música mexicana represents the research carried onat various churches of Mexico by Dr.Lazos, research that can be consulted through the catalogues of the cathedrals of San Cristobal de Las Casas (MEX-SCAH) in Chiapas, of Tulancingo (MEX-TAHC) in Hidalgo, and the parishes of Chazumba (MEX-Schamp) and Suchixtlahuaca (MEX -SCSamp) in Oaxaca. Components of a rich music tradition, dated from the sixteenth century, the majority of the manuscripts of these four catalogues belong toMexico'sleast known music period,Independent Mexico. Dr.Lazosargues that the life and works of José Antonio Gómez y Olguín (1805-1876), will shed lighton the music practice of this period. Active as an organist, pianist, conductor, composer, teacher, editor (havingpublished several methods, though not originalauthorshipof theory, voice and piano), founder of a Conservatory and jury member of the National Anthem, the works ofGomez, like those of many Mexican and foreign composers, still await cataloguing and study. Moreover, we hopeto be able to eventually hearthe sounds of the nineteenth-century music that the publicenjoyed in Mexico.
