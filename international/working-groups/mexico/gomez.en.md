# José Antonio Gómez y Olguín’s (1805-1876) music catalogue

Thanks to a grant by the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (FONCA) of Mexico, Dr. Lazos has completed the music catalogue of José Antonio Gómez y Olguín’s (1805-1876). Gómez’s legacyrepresents a century of music practice. He began as a soloist in a children’s choir, studied at the Colegiata de Guadalupe, and was already working as the third organist of the Mexican City Cathedral months prior to Mexico’s independence. He flourished at the most important church in Mexico for over four decades where he wrote numerous works ‒as well as conducting its orchestra. Soon after becoming its first organist, Gómez turned to the secular milieu where he performed, taught, published several music methods (although he was not the author), founded his own Conservatory and was even member of the jury that chose the National Anthem. His works were still performed at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Gómez’s catalogue of approximately 140 music manuscripts housed in seven different churches and church archives, will shed light on the most prolific Mexican musician of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
