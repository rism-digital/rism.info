The working group RISM-Chinese Language Region was planned at a conference concerning the Collaborative Project on Chinese Music Resources (CPCMR) held in October 2015. CPCMR was launched to promote the collection of Chinese music literature, to develop technical standards for processing the archive, and to ultimately establish a collaborative network for resource sharing.
