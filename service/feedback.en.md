# Report a correction

RISM welcomes any errors, corrections, or addenda that you bring to our attention and we will try to correct them as soon as possible. Please send an e-mail to [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info) to let us know if you encounter mistakes or wish to alert us to any issues such as:

* You can identify an anonymous piece
* You wish to report additional copies of a printed edition
* Attribution to a certain composer is incorrect
* There is a typographical error
* Other things you would like to point out

For **printed music**, please include the RISM publication citation (A/I or B/I number, or a page number), name of the library or holding institution, shelfmark, and the plate number (if you have it).

For items in the **RISM online catalog**, please include the 9-digit RISM number (located on the bottom right of the record) and describe the issue as thoroughly as you can. It is helpful when you can point us to evidence such as secondary literature or information in another RISM record.

You are welcome to send us any general comments about the online catalog as well.

Thank you for taking the time to help us improve the database for RISM users around the world.
