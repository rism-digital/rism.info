# Send us your feedback

RISM welcomes any feedback, addenda, or corrections that you bring to our attention. Please send an e-mail to [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info) and we will be in touch as soon as possible.

If using our contact address above, make sure to include the ID number of the RISM record you are commenting on. Alternately, each record in the RISM database also has a link to a feedback form:  
- In the RISM Catalog, you will find "Send a comment on this record" on the left-hand side of each record.
- In RISM Online, a link called "Report an issue" can be found at the bottom of each record.

When commenting on a RISM record, please describe the issue as thoroughly as you can. It is helpful when you can point us to evidence such as secondary literature or information from another RISM record.  

Thank you for taking the time to help us improve the database for RISM users around the world.
