## Data collection

The data collected by us are collected and stored exclusively for the purpose of providing our services. How long we store the data is determined by how long services are provided.

## Using the website

Data concerning your visits to our website are stored for the purpose of making the website available. This happens through a firewall, which protects the website from malicious access, as well as through the provision of the website itself. In both cases, the data are anonymized to the greatest possible extent and can only be traced back through the IP address. Storing the corresponding log files happens automatically. Only in very rare cases are the logs checked for their technical content.

The following data are saved when you access our website:

* The IP address from which access is routed
* Date and time of access
* The webpage to which access is directed
* The browser, browser version, and operating system of the device accessing the site

## Storing your personal data

Personal data are stored in the running system for a maximum of one month. Personal data can also be stored longer in a data backup system. However, these data are deleted immediately should the backup be restored. The backups are protected against access by third parties and are not used for any purpose other than to ensure the possibility of restoring a working system in the event of a failure.

## Website statistics

We use Google Analytics to analyze website usage. The data obtained from this is used to optimize our website.

Google Analytics is a web analysis service operated and provided by Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States). Google processes website usage data on our behalf and is contractually committed to measures that ensure the confidentiality of the data that is processed.

Data is recorded during your website visit, including the following information:

* Pages viewed
* The achievement of website goals (such as contact requests)  
* Your behavior on pages (such as clicks, scrolling behavior, and time spent)  
* Your approximate location (country and city)  
* Your IP address (in abbreviated form, preventing unambiguous identification)  
* Technical information such as browser, internet provider, end user device, and screen resolution  
* Source of your visit (which website or advertising medium brought you to us)  

This data is transferred to a Google server in the United States. In doing so, Google observes the data protection provisions of the EU-US Privacy Shield.

Google Analytics stores cookies in your web browser for a period of two years since your last visit. These cookies contain a randomly generated user ID with which you can be recognized during future website visits.

The data that is recorded is stored together with the randomly generated user ID, which enables the evaluation of anonymized user profiles. This user-related data is automatically deleted after 14 months. Other data remains stored in aggregated form indefinitely.

If you do not wish for this data to be collected, you can prevent it with a one-time installation of a browser add-on that disables Google Analytics.

An analysis of the statistics is published in the Annual Report. The anonymized data about website usage is deleted after 400 days and the aggregate reports after 24 months.

## Links to social media

There are two areas on our website that link to social media. In the footer of each page, buttons are available that allow you to follow RISM on social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In the "News" section of our website, users can share or bookmark the contents of our site using social media buttons. By clicking on one of these buttons, users are taken to the website of the social media network. Only then are data passed on to these providers. Please consult each provider for information on their data protection guidelines.

## Contact information

If you contact us on your own initiative, whether electronically or by other means, we will store your contact informtion. If you are wondering about the type and duration of storage, please contact the person who answers your inquiry. Should it become apparent in the course of contact with us that it is in your interest to pass on your email address or other contact information to a third party, this will not happen without your knowledge.
