## Data collection

The data collected by us are collected and stored exclusively for the purpose of providing our services. How long we store the data is determined by how long services are provided.

## Using the website

Data concerning your visits to our website are stored for the purpose of making the website available. On the one hand, this happens through a firewall, which protects the website from malicious access. On the other hand, this is done through the provision of the website itself. In both cases, the data are anonymized to the greatest possible extent and can only be traced back through the IP address. Storing the corresponding log files happens automatically. Only in very rare cases are the logs checked for their technical content.

The following data are saved when you access our website:

* The IP address from which access is routed
* Date and time of access
* The webpage to which access is directed
* The browser, browser version, and operating system of the device accessing the site

## Storing your personal data

Personal data are stored in the running system for a maximum of one month. Personal data can also be stored longer in a data backup system. However, these data are deleted immediately should the backup be restored. The backups are protected against access by third parties and are not used for any purpose other than to ensure the possibility of restoring a working system in the event of a failure.

## Website statistics

We keep statistics on the visits made to our website and how the website is used. This service is set up directly by us; more information can be found on [matomo.org](https://matomo.org/){:target="_blank"}. Data we collect are not passed on to third parties, neither to Matomo nor to other corporate bodies.

In the statistics, IP addresses are anonymized and processed. Other data that are collected include the type of browser, the operating system, country, and type of device. Cookies are used to collect statistics.

An analysis of the statistics is published in the Annual Report. The anonymized data about website usage is deleted after 400 days and the aggregate reports after 24 months.

## Links to social media

There are two areas on our website that link to social media. In the footer of each page, buttons are available that allow you to follow RISM on social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. By clicking on one of these buttons, users are taken to the website of the social media network. Only then are data passed on to these providers. Please consult each provider for information on their data protection guidelines.

In the "News" section of our website, users can share or bookmark the contents of our site using social media buttons. These buttons are implemented through the ShareThis plugin. Please consult [sharethis.com](https://sharethis.com) for information on how they use your data.

## Contact information

If you contact us on your own initiative, whether electronically or by other means, we will store your contact informtion. If you are wondering about the type and duration of storage, please contact the person who answers your inquiry. Should it become apparent in the course of contact with us that it is in your interest to pass on your email address or other contact information to a third party, this will not happen without your knowledge.
