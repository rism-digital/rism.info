# Frequently Asked Questions

## Which sources can be found in RISM?

The [online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/){:target="_blank"} contains over 1,000,000 entries, mainly manuscripts from between the years 1600 and 1850. As of summer 2015, there are also ca. 100,000 entries for printed music published up to 1800 by a single composer and printed collections published between 1500 and 1550. Even though the emphasis of manuscript cataloging is on the years 1600-1850, [you will find both older and newer sources](/new_at_rism/2015/08/12/results-of-the-rism-user-study-part-iii-your.html){:target="_blank"} in the online catalog. 

Some of the bigger libraries are not (yet) completely documented in RISM but they tend to have - as opposed to, say, smaller church libraries - their own comprehensive, searchable catalog. With the improvements in recent years in data transfer technology, these data [will also eventually be published](/new_at_rism/2015/08/14/results-of-the-rism-user-study-part-iv-your.html){:target="_blank"} in the online catalog. Sources that are now lost are not documented in RISM.

RISM's [book publications](/publications.html), specifically series B, document groups of sources by topic. Most of the volumes in series B are not in the online catalog but can be consulted in well-stocked research libraries. 

## How complete is RISM?

We estimate - based on a survey we sent to our national groups 20 years ago - that there are approximately 1.8 million extant manuscripts dating between 1600 and 1800 and at least 2 million from between 1800 and 1950. Of printed music to 1800, there must be around 140,000 copies still extant. Thanks to new printing technology, this figure increases rapidly during the nineteenth century and there might be as many as 4 million music prints worldwide from this time. But our numbers are just estimates; nobody can count such a large amount. 

RISM is, therefore, far from complete, but it is the most comprehensive resource for musical sources there is.

## How do you use the online catalog?

Please see the catalog's [Help page](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4&L=1){:target="_blank"}.

## Where can I get copies of the music?

Music must be obtained directly from the holding institution itself. Some libraries offer digitized collections on their websites; whenever possible, RISM links to these digital surrogates directly in the records. If you do not find a digitized copy of the source, you must contact the library. Click on the library siglum to find the contact information. 

## Can I reuse data from the RISM online catalog?

Yes! Both the authority records as well as the records for the sources themselves are freely available as linked open data through a Creative Commons [CC-BY license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/){:target="_blank"}. You can download the data in MARCXML and RDF format. More information is available on the [linked open data](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=8&L=1&id=8){:target="_blank"} page.

## How is RISM structured?

RISM relies on the work of individuals and working groups from around the world who catalog the musical sources in their own country in the international RISM database. Information about the structure of RISM can be found [here](/organization/project-structure.html){:target="_blank"}.

## How can I find a RISM contact person near me?

Please consult the list of [RISM working groups worldwide](/international.html){:target="_blank"}. If your country is not listed, please [contact us](mailto:contact@rism.info).
