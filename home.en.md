The **RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM)** - International Inventory of Musical Sources - is an international, non-profit organization that aims to comprehensively document extant musical sources worldwide: manuscripts, printed music editions, writings on music theory, and libretti that are found in libraries, archives, churches, schools, and private collections. RISM's over 1.4 million records can be searched at no cost through the **RISM Catalog** and **RISM Online.** RISM was founded in Paris in 1952 and is the largest and only global organization that documents written musical sources. RISM records _what_ exists and _where_ it can be found.
