This catalog contains manuscripts and printed music from the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (V-CVbav). The bulk of the sources date from between 1474 and ca. 1620 and are from the Fondo Cappella Sistina collection (shelfmarks Capp. Sist. 13-80). All of these sources can also be found in the international RISM online catalogue.
