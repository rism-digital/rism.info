The International Inventory of Musical Sources (Répertoire International des Sources Musicales – RISM), with the Zentralredaktion in Frankfurt, is under the patronage of the Association Internationale des Bibliothèques, Archives et Centres de Documentation Musicaux (AIBM) as well as the Société Internationale de Musicologie (SIM) and is responsible for documenting printed and manuscript transmissions of music worldwide. Series A/I indexes individual prints published between 1600 and 1800, and series A/II indexes music manuscripts after 1600, with extensive descriptions, including their locations. Both series originally were to be arranged alphabetically by composer name, as is the case in the printed volumes of series A/I. Since both series are now published as databases, far more access points can be offered. Series B is designed to cover specific categories of repertory, such as printed anthologies from the 16th to 18th centuries, German hymns, source literature on music theory in Latin, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew and Persian, etc. Series A/I, A/II, and B are supplemented by series C, the Directory of Music Research Libraries.  
**Series A/I:** Issued in nine main volumes, four supplementary volumes, and one index, and on CD-ROM. The CD-ROM of series A/I was released in December 2011. It contains all of the entries from volumes 1-9 and the supplements. The CD-ROM data were converted and transferred to the future cataloging program Muscat (see below). Some working groups have been adding information to the A/I records. The data are scheduled to be published in the RISM online catalog in early 2015.   
**Series B:** Thirty-one volumes in this series have been published so far, most recently RISM B/XIII,1: Hymnologica Slavica. Volume I, Hymnologica Bohemica, Slovaca, Polonica, Sorabica. Notendrucke des 16. bis 18. Jahrhunderts. Edited by Karol Hławiczka, Jan Kouba, Leon Witkowski, Jan Raupp, Marie Skalická. Revised and supplemented by Teresa Krukowski and Gerhard Schuhmacher (Henle Verlag: Munich, 2012).  
For volume B/I (anthologies), Howard Mayer Brown had prepared a revision of the entries for sources published between 1500 and 1550. This revision will not appear in book form but will be incorporated into the online catalog. Preparations have been completed here as they were with the A/I data and the data are scheduled to be published in early 2015.  
Three special volumes entitled Das Tenorlied were published between 1979 and 1986.  
**Series C:** Five volumes have appeared to date, as well as a special volume issued by the RISM Zentralredaktion, RISM Bibliothekssigel-Gesamtverzeichnis (RISM Library Sigla, Complete Index). Since that time, the index of sigla has been made available through RISM’s website as a searchable database, which also contains contact information such as mailing address, website link, and e-mail address. From the siglum entry, one can directly access the holdings of a library as indexed in the online catalog. Together with the AIBM Publications Committee it has been possible to issue revised versions of volumes II and III,1. These replace the existing volumes II and III, with the exception of the section containing Italian sigla. An agreement has been made with the AIBM working group Access to Music Archives to revise the series, which will be edited and published as an online database. To initiate this process, the above-named volumes II and III were scanned and sent to the relevant working groups for editing.  
**Series A/II:** This series is a complete documentation of manuscripts containing polyphonic music written after 1600. Series A/II is the most comprehensive endeavor that the entire RISM project is undertaking and is its main focus at present. Contributors from more than 35 national groups around the world document music manuscripts at their home libraries and archives. The national working groups use computers to enter their descriptions and the majority of them connect directly to the RISM server through the Internet. To facilitate this, the cataloging program Kallisto is available from the Zentralredaktion free of charge. The transmission of digital information reduces the amount of editorial work required and speeds up completion of the project.

Since the start of the project a total of ca. 905,000 entries have been registered at the RISM Zentralredaktion in Frankfurt.

The following groups used Kallisto in 2014 to create new records for works: Austria, Innsbruck: 506 records, Lambach: 571 records, Linz: 107 records, Salzburg: 62 records + 122 records (Mozarteum), Schlägl: 217 records, Vorarlberg: 4 records, Vienna (Akademie der Wissenschaften): 322 records; Canada: 12 records; Czech Republic, Prague: 1,052 records; Germany, Dresden: 5,179 records, Munich: 11,381 records, partnership with the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin: 2,468 records; Hungary: 800 records; Italy, Rome (DHI): 72 records; Lithuania: 1 record; Poland, Opole: 300 records, Warsaw: 1,578 records, Wrocław: 49 records; Russia (Glinka Museum, Moscow): 168 records; Slovakia: 127 records; Slovenia: 602 records; South Korea: 11 records; Ukraine: 1 record; United Sates: 1 record; Venezuela: 20 records.

In addition, 4,164 records were entered into Kallisto by the Zentralredaktion from older holdings. The US RISM office also entered 672 new incipits and reported data for an additional 820 works, resulting in a total of 2,544 new or changed records (including music incipits).

Some working groups use their own cataloging systems and sometimes send their data after a longer preliminary period. We wish to mention the following in particular:  
**England/United Kingdom:** A database of music manuscripts was developed together with the RISM office in Ireland. The database is freely available online ([www.rism.org.uk](http://www.rism.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}). In the first half of 2011, 55,000 records were converted and transferred to the RISM database. The data were published in the RISM online catalog in December 2011.  
**Switzerland:** The Swiss working group did not participate in the changeover to Kallisto. Instead, they have been using a program that employs the same data model of the British working group. The data that have been entered since then will be transferred to the RISM database when the new cataloging program is developed (see below).  
**France:** At the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, a database was created of music manuscripts kept there, from which a book catalog (of composers with last names beginning A–B) was published in 1999. In addition, as part of the series Patrimoine musical régional, handwritten and printed materials in the provinces were processed and also published as a book catalog. In the meantime, records from RISM France can be found in the portal “Catalogue collectif de France” ([http://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/jsp](http://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/jsp){:target="_blank"}). There are records for ca. 8,000 manuscripts that were created before 1820 (by composers with last names beginning A–H) and 15,600 items of printed music before 1800 from the Département de la musique, and ca. 34,000 records from the Patrimoine. An agreement has been made to receive this data and sample records were tested.  
**Italy:** Coordinated by the Ufficio Ricerca Fondi Musicali (URFM) in Milan, various regional groups are working on the documentation of manuscripts, prints and other sources. Records are entered into the national SBN Musica database, which is administered by the Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo unico delle Biblioteche Italiane (ICCU). An agreement has been reached with ICCU to transfer this data to RISM. At the same time, the working group Istituto di Bibliografia Musicale (IBIMUS) in Rome has been using the program PIKaDo and sends their records directly to the Zentralredaktion in the course of their projects. Kallisto will be implemented when the next projects begin.

Furthermore, there are partnerships with individual institutes:  
As part of a project sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the German Historical Institute in Rome is undertaking work on the collections of two Roman princely houses. The sources are being digitized and described using Kallisto in accordance with RISM standards.  
An agreement was made with the Richard Strauss Quellenverzeichnis to have the descriptions of musical sources contained on their website ([www.rsi-rsqv.de](http://www.rsi-rsqv.de/){:target="_blank"}) also appear in the RISM online catalog. So far, 650 records have been imported.  
As part of the DFG KoFIM project (Kompetenzzentrum Forschung und Information Musik/Center of Excellence for Research and Information in Music), the collection of autograph manuscripts at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin are being digitized and described using RISM’s software. Not only will sources be recorded in the RISM online catalog, but links to their digitized counterparts will be added as well.  
A further partnership exists with the Archivio della cantata italiana (Clori). Since there is some overlap with the data in ICCU, data from the Clori project will be transferred after the ICCU data.

RISM is also interested in further partnerships with databases of sources from projects that produce critical editions. Data from such projects that are transferred to the RISM database should include links to the original databases and elements that are necessary for searching.

During the reporting period, the RISM manuscript database increased by an additional 30,000 entries and it now contains a total of ca. 890,000 records.

The CD-ROM of series A/II Music Manuscripts after 1600 was discontinued with the 16th edition (the 14th CD-ROM) in 2008. It comprised a total of 614,000 entries, including a total of around 50,000 additional entries from three separate files – one with composers (31,000 entries), library sigla (6,870 entries) and an index of the literature consulted for describing sources (4,000 entries).  
This is the material which is still currently being offered as a subscription database by EBSCO Publishing Inc. (successor to NISC).

Since July 2010, RISM has made its online catalog freely available on the Internet. The development of the software for searching was made possible through collaboration between RISM and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich and the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz. Around 180,000 records have been added to the initial inventory of ca. 700,000 records to make a grand total of around 880,000 records. On average, the online catalog was visited by about 6,500 people per month over 27,000 visits (annually: 85,500 people with 288,000 page views).

A new version of the online catalog was released in April 2014. In addition to the many advantages in searching and improvements to the presentation, there is a filter to limit the results to records with links to digitized items, allowing users direct access to images of the source. There are currently ca. 12,000 such links in the catalog.

Since July 2013, the data in the online catalog have been available as open data. They were also made available as linked open data with the new release of the catalog. This service is directed at libraries that wish to import their records into local catalogs, or musicological projects that want to make a catalog of sources that covers a specific topic as a basis for research. The Zentralredaktion has developed tools to simplify the data delivery process, including an SRU interface. It is RISM's wish that users take advantage of these services in order to share corrections or supplemental information with the Zentralredaktion. Additional tools will be developed for this.

The online catalog, which is available on the Internet free of charge, motivates more and more people and institutions to contribute to the project. In particular, there is growing interest among individual institutions to see their holdings indexed in the RISM online catalog. The Zentralredaktion also increasingly receives suggestions and corrections from users.

The RISM Zentralredaktion considers one of its tasks to be providing optimal technical and advisory support to the working groups. In technical areas, data exchanges and software development are in the foreground.

With the development of the new cataloging program Muscat, which is being carried out in cooperation with the Swiss working group, enough progress was made that a test version could be sent to the Coordinating Committee.

Advisory support begins by training contributors in new or existing working groups. From an editorial standpoint, the Zentralredaktion is responsible for unifying data and editing authority files: personal names, institutions, and (sacred) texts. This is carried out in close cooperation with the working groups, which receive continuous supervision. To improve communication with working groups, users, and other people interested in RISM, the Zentralredaktion has developed several tools in recent years:

The RISM website, developed with the cooperation of the Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur (Digitale Akademie) in Mainz, is regularly updated by the Zentralredaktion and the working groups. It enjoys increasing popularity, having welcomed 40,627 visitors this year, or about 3,385 visitors each month. In total, 1,462 people have registered on the website.   
A [RISM Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RISM.info){:target="_blank"} appeals to another international audience and has 1,065 fans. RISM is also active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RISM_music){:target="_blank"}.  
The brochure [RISM: An Overview](/publications/brochures.html) may be obtained from the Zentralredaktion. It is available in an English-German version as well as English-Russian.   
On [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9pertoire_International_des_Sources_Musicales){:target="_blank"}, short articles in Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish are available.
