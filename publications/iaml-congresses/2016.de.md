The organ, built in 1744 by one of the best eighteenth-century organ builders in Rome (who had immigrated from Austria), is in the sacred room in which the oratorio as a music genre began. The Oratorio del Crocifisso is completely decorated with frescos by representative artists from Rome ca. 1580/90 and otherwise rarely open to visitors.  
  
After a short introduction to the instrument and room, the Wörle organ will be sounded live in a short concert with eighteenth-century repertoire from Rome, held by libraries in Rome (Biblioteca dell’Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei e Corsiniana [I-Rli] and Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale [I-Rn]), including works by Girolamo Chiti (director of music at the Basilika S. Giovanni in Laterano from 1726) and anonymous _alternatim_ pieces.
