  - David Blum (Moravian Music Foundation, Winston-Salem, NC) Experience using bibliographic records downloaded from RISM      
**Abstract** : The [Moravian Music Foundation](http://moravianmusic.org/){:target="_blank"} (with offices and collections in Winston-Salem, NC and Bethlehem, PA) is more than halfway through a three-year project to bring its catalog online. The MMF holds over 10,000 manuscripts and early imprints representing not only music of the Moravians, but also by European masters, mostly from the late 18thand early 19thcenturies, which Moravians collected, copied, studied, and enjoyed. To bring awareness of this vast store to students, researchers, musicians, and musicologists, the MMF is mounting a coordinated effort to upload and enhance records to both OCLC and to RISM, and to provide links between both systems to enrich the search capabilities of each. This paper will outline the project history, focus on the particular challenges of one collection (the Johannes Herbst Collection), and provide a vision going forward.
