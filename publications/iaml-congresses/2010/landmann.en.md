### Ortrun Landmann, Dresden

# Notes on the Music Copyists of the Dresden Court, 1720-1850

The chronological boundaries of this topic arise out of the present
situation of the sources in Dresden. In the year 1760, during the Seven
Years’ War, part of the city of Dresden went up in flames under Prussian
bombardment, including a royal-electoral palace. In it resided the music
archive of the court chapel, namely the musical repository of the 16th
and 17th centuries, including the compositional legacy of Heinrich
Schütz. Research on this earlier time has been significantly impeded by
the loss, and an abundance of sources is only preserved beginning with
manuscripts dating from ca. 1720. Then around 1850, as a result of the
development of cost-effective music printing processes, the use of
printed materials becomes more frequent. Handwritten materials
increasingly prove to be copies of printed editions and are less
valuable as transmitted sources. Some of the printed editions themselves
were produced on wood-based paper, which over time deteriorates through
acid buildup.

In many places, in particular German Protestant churches, such copies
along with printer’s copies were destroyed after the Second World War.
The style of the surviving sources, being in the “late Romantic” style,
had fallen out of fashion and, so they said, cost unnecessary storage
space. Due to the multifaceted meaning as documents of their time that
one can see in copies and prints, we RISM contributors have advocated
everywhere being very careful when weeding collections. It may well be
that the surviving original sources from the second half of the 19th
century will become rarities. Then an organization succeeding RISM will
have to dedicate itself to describing and preserving such documents.

Now on to the topic itself.

The royal-electoral Saxon court in Dresden distinguished itself for
centuries through a rich, exquisite musical life. As the basis for the
musicians’ work, music materials were required that, in accordance with
the practice of the time, overwhelmingly had to be written by hand. The
first documents that attest to employing full-time music copyists for
the Dresden court chapel originated in the 17th century. Beginning in
the early 18th century, the need for music materials grew significantly
with the expansion of an orchestra within the court chapel and the
overall blossoming of instrumental music.

Two to three “part-timers” who were also active as court organists or
cantors could no longer accomplish the work alone, in spite of
additional help from outside copyists. As a result, in 1733 two
“full-timers” had to be hired. In 1754, this number grew to four, yet
additional outside help was still needed.

It is evident that a “scribal school” developed, in that the
professional copyists trained young assistants, some of whom advanced to
become their successors. Characteristics of
French,<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" id="sdfootnote1anc">[1]</a>
Italian,<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" id="sdfootnote2anc">[2]</a> and
Bohemian <a href="#sdfootnote3sym" id="sdfootnote3anc">[3]</a> writing
combined with the Saxon chancellery writing
<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" id="sdfootnote4anc">[4]</a> and led to scripts
with larger “family resemblances” throughout the entire time period
under consideration here. Remarkable clarity ranks among its
recognizable features—befitting the prevailing use of music by
candlelight—as well as an often noticeably aesthetic charm. Added to
this is the extensive reliability of written objects from Dresden. In
the early 19th century, the director (that is, the administrative head)
of the Dresden court chapel solicited the Saxon king for salary
improvements for the copyists and took the opportunity to clearly
explain the difference between a chancellery *scribe* and a *music*
*copyist*: While the former has to painfully copy everything exactly as
the original presented it, the latter must, all at the same time, be on
the lookout for mistakes and correct them; he must be capable of
transposing arias from one key to another; and must also independently
incorporate all revisions that are decided at solo and orchestra
rehearsals. A professional music copyist was therefore expected to be
well-versed in music theory, just as a church cantor or a city or court
Kapellmeister would.

All large music centers have their typical scripts. But while such
schools generally emerged from workshops producing material for the
commercial market, the catalyst for cultivating a school in Dresden
was—as was the case in some other larger residences—the court itself as
a permanent “employer.” The court needed its own music copyists as a
result of its considerable need for parts for singers and
instrumentalists as well as scores for the members of the ruling family
and gifts for acquaintances of the court. Furthermore, insomuch as time
allowed, the copyists produced piano excerpts and scores to sell to
private buyers.

In these ways, music prepared by Dresden copyists spread far beyond the
Dresden court from the moment it was completed because the Dresden
repertoire was always of international interest. The compositions in
Dresden were predominantly for the Catholic court church, Italian opera,
and court festivals. To a lesser degree, works of foreign origin were
also performed. In the 19th century, in an age of musical historicism,
libraries and private collectors were interested in acquiring music
manuscripts through payment or trade.

As a result, manuscripts by Dresden copyists can be found today in
numerous European libraries, from London and Madrid, through Naples and
Vienna, to Copenhagen, Stockholm and probably St. Petersburg, not to
mention German libraries in Berlin, Munich, etc. The ability to
recognize music materials of Dresden origin would be relevant for many
of today’s music collections.

Since the end of 2009, an article has been available online
<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" id="sdfootnote5anc">[5]</a> that presents more
than 300 images of handwriting samples by the Dresden court copyists,
some typical examples of music by external copyists, as well as 40
images of covers of the Dresden Royal Private Music Collection (Dresdner
Königliche Privat-Musikaliensammlung) and some additional covers from
Dresden opera libretto prints starting in 1765. The vast majority of the
original illustrations are held by the Saxon State Library—City and
University Library Dresden (Sächsichen Landesbibliothek—Staats- und
Universitätsbibliothek Dresden; D-Dl).

Since identifying a copyist becomes more certain when one knows his
“normal” handwriting, the article illustrates, whenever possible,
handwriting samples of the music copyists, taken from the Saxon State
Archive, Dresden (Sächsischen Hauptstaatsarchiv Dresden; D-Da).
Complications often arise due to the often significant variations in
lettering used in music compared to that in correspondence. In the
former, the Latin alphabet was overwhelmingly used; in the
correspondence, though, it was Gothic script. In the case of the
correspondence, one has to look for foreign words that were written with
Latin letters in order to enable a comparison to the often very
distinguishable standardized characters in the musical materials.

The shapes that are normally considered characteristic of a copyist—such
as accidentals, rests, stems, as well as the tendency to write with a
left or right slant—are not enough to identify a copyist with a
particular “school.” It is often the case that most copyists experienced
an evolution of their own writing; their early and late letterings are
sometimes significantly different. One can only recognize such
developments when one has handwriting samples of the copyist from
various phases of his career. Datable objects, such as opera materials
with known first performances, are especially helpful.

A difficulty that one does not see every day arises when two copyists
worked together at the same time, whereby one wrote all the notes and
the other wrote the lettering (such as voice, movement, and dynamic
designations as well as the song texts). This is usually observed with
beginners who wrote the notes while the mentor filled in everything
else.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" id="sdfootnote6anc">[6]</a> In cases
where two experienced copyists worked together, it is probably because
they were in a rush to complete the manuscript. Different quills were
presumably used for the notes and lettering. Changing writing
instruments evidently meant a loss of time, which one could avoid in
this way.

Apart from these exceptions, the *lettering* is always the main means of
identifying copyists.

An additional area of research is the paper that was used. We all know
from Bach studies what significance watermarks hold for dating the
autographs of Johann Sebastian Bach and copies of his works.

With a rich pool of sources as is in Dresden, the situation is
different: the copyists are for the most part identified, their dates of
service are known, and there are enough verified dates as fixed points.
There were paper mills in Saxon and specifically one near Dresden whose
products were used in the Saxon chancelleries as well as by music
copyists. But the copyists also used foreign paper (such as Dutch) that
one could find at the Leipzig trade fairs, or paper brought home by
individual musicians and Kapellmeisters from their travels (Italian and
Viennese paper). In such cases where foreign paper was used, only
knowledge of the copyist reveals the place of origin of a manuscript.

Paper can also be important for identifying “genuine” Dresden copyists,
including outside copyists hired to assist the permanent music copyists,
as opposed to the ones who had trained in Dresden but were employed
elsewhere. The latter may, for example, be detectable in the copyist
circle of the Leipzig music publisher Breitkopf, where the expert
elegant, clear script learned in Dresden was certainly well-received.
Paper that Breitkopf used is no doubt already known and can be
distinguished from the type used at the Dresden court.

In addition, the informative value of the paper in the Dresden original
sources should not be neglected, particularly concerning materials that
were used and re-edited over a longer period of time. In opera scores,
one sees inserts and pasteovers. In church music, there are parts that
were copied at a later time, and while both the original copyists and
the later ones might be the same, they used different paper. In these
cases, the paper shows first and foremost that the material in question
was changed at a later date or that inserts were made for a specific
performance of an opera. Ideally, the original edition is still extant
in its complete form (sometimes with pins, sometimes fastened with yarn)
and new pieces or the transposition of the original into a different key
were simply inserted into the score. Such conductor’s scores, which also
formed the basis for the parts, are invaluable in recognizing the stage
version that they served.

In Dresden, alongside scores created for opera performances, there are
clean copies that were completed for the court. They were mostly copied
in one sitting from edited performance copies and do not permit
recognition of related component parts. Here it is clear that the
cleanest, most correction-free music manuscripts are not necessarily
authentic drafts. Bibliographically describing manuscripts comprising
disparate elements admittedly takes some effort, but it shows the
relevance of a source to a particular place and its specific performance
practice. Such a source has a musically historical value that approaches
that of an autograph copy even when the whereabouts of the autograph are
known. But one can determine *which* local performance practice the
manuscript speaks to when the local copyists are known and can be
recognized in the
sources.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" id="sdfootnote7anc">[7]</a>
