# RISM Lectures  
The Répertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) has long provided both musicologists and performing musicians with indispensable research tools. Currently, RISM’s freely available online database includes over 1.4 million records for musical sources held in diverse institutions around the world. Major additions to the database have oftentimes resulted from larger-scale projects targeting specific repertories, and including these in RISM should inspire and facilitate further, in-depth research.

The RISM Board of Directors has launched a lecture series in the hope of calling greater attention to such valuable collections and also to underscore RISM’s role as a mediator between the worlds of music researchers and librarians—in accordance with its double sponsorship by the  [International Musicological Society](https://www.musicology.org/){:blank} and the [International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres](https://www.iaml.info/){:blank}.
