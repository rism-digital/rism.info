**From Data, Understanding the Past, Orienting the Future**     
Understanding a peripheral cathedral within a globalized empire requires an empirical look from the perspective of the periphery, so as not to preconceive the periphery as a duplication of the center. This is especially true when the object is the ritual music of a culture that legitimized itself through that very ritual, a ritual imposed by blood and fire onto a totally alien culture resulting in its decimation. It is a discussion about conquest, not simply colonization, and something more complex than “transplantation.” How are we to interpret and understand the products of this cultural phenomenon, specifically liturgical music, across multiple centuries of history?

As the leaders of the Seminario de Música en la Nueva España y el México Independiente, we have embraced such reasoning to shape our long-term research at Mexico City Cathedral, which has included cataloguing its music archive in printed and electronic formats. As we discovered it was necessary to rethink certain concepts, structures, and guidelines to accommodate the repertoires present, we developed, for example, the concept of the Collection of Collections (“Cocol”) and reanimated the idea of the Factitious Collection, so that we were able to express, in a clearer and more complete way, what the documents were showing us. This open way of interpreting has defined our values and oriented our epistemological decisions, which try to avoid rehashing older discourses that constructed and circulated myths about the New Spanish past.

As concrete examples of how we have translated our values into electronic and printed catalog entries, we will examine several case studies from our current work on Mass Ordinaries, including Mexican arrangements of music printed in Augsburg around 1830, and a complex case of two manuscript anthologies of bass lines compiled for the use of organists, the first in the 1830s and the second in 1895 that, along with loose vocal parts, concordances in choir books, and extemporization in performance, show a living repertoire that was and is neither complete nor incomplete in documentary form. In sum, our periphery-centric values of treating original sources and local arrangements on par have complicated the cataloging process, but have enhanced our historical knowledge and understanding of the data.

**How Medieval Trash Became Musical Treasure: Virtual Encounters with Notated Liturgical Fragments in Marsh’s Library, Dublin**  
Erik Kwakkle observed that the “early history of the Bible as a book could not be written if we were to throw out fragment evidence”. Scholars such as Leo Treitler have reflected on the problematic musicological tendency to classify certain sources as ‘central’ and others as ‘peripheral’. Yet fragments of notated chant manuscripts have received scant attention by comparison to their more complete counterparts. The evidentiary value of _disiecta membra musicae_ is not to be underestimated, however. As well as bearing witness to humanity’s ability to create, destroy, recycle and — in the case of biblioclasts, such as Otto Ege — to profit, these parchment scraps can often yield critical testimony about regional devotional observances, prescribed liturgical rituals, and musical, cultural and intellectual practices.  

Dublin’s Marsh’s Library (IRL-Dm) is home to a collection of miscellaneous fragments taken from bindings during the tenure of Newport B. White (Librarian, 1931-57) and kept, as a collection, in a wooden box in the Y room. This paper introduces some of the liturgico-musical fragments that form part of this collection and, more specifically, presents the findings of a comparative palaeographic/repertorial study of fragment 176 carried out during the pandemic, using digital image archives and online databases. Notational and palaeographic evidence suggests that this fragment comes from a late twelfth-century antiphoner of insular origin, and as such, it bears important witness to a liturgical tradition from a transitional, post-Conquest period _before_ the pervasive influence of Use of Sarum, a field impacted by a paucity of representational sources.

**A New Look at an Old Book: Investigating the Making of I-Fl MS Pluteus 29.1**  
The Medici antiphonary **I-Fl MS Pluteus 29.1** is recognised as one of the most important and voluminous sources for our understanding of medieval music at a crucial moment in its history: that of the 13th century polyphonic repertoire (_organum_, _motetus_, and _conductus_) as it developed in the north of France, and in particular at the Notre Dame cathedral of Paris. Several seminal studies have already examined the antiphonary’s codicological, liturgical or paleographical aspects. Its repertoire has been scrutinised and identified as the descendant of the _Magnus liber organi_ mentioned by Anonymous IV in his widely discussed treatise. Hypotheses have been formulated about the context of elaboration and its supposed commissioners. Little information, however, has been gathered to help us understand the antiphonary’s manufacture as a music book, as a material object. How did the craftsmen work? What traces of the copyist’s tasks and skills may still be observed?  

This paper seeks to retrace the paths of the scribes’ and notators’ labour: their methods, how the pages were laid out, and the procedures involved in designing and crafting them. This careful analysis of the most pragmatic aspects of the craftsmen’s book-making offers surprising results, bringing to light different scenarios of material production that have hitherto gone unnoticed. Such insights help us understand the manufacturing skills characteristic of an emergent category of urban music-book makers, whose practices depart from the monastic habits that had been long cultivated in the _scriptoria_. One may see _I-Fl MS Pluteus. 29.1_ as the “tip of the iceberg” in so far as it intimates the existence of an entire new expertise in book production in 13th-century Paris, one that grew along the streets and in the workshops of the cathedral area.

**Complex Codices: Describing the Syntax of Late Medieval and Early Modern Music Manuscripts**  
The organisation of medieval and early modern codices has long challenged the understanding of codicologists in understanding their structure as non-unitary objects. One of the most significant new trends in contemporary codicology is the study of the complex structure of these manuscripts, on which several contributions have appeared in the past decades. Different terminologies and concepts have been put forward to describe these manuscripts with varying degree of success. The codex is now understood as an entity with its own grammar: the morphology deals with the constituting elements of a manuscript, and the syntax considers the relationship between these elements in order to understand the book as a whole.  

While these are matters amply debated in cataloguing manuscripts, they have been substantially ignored by musicologists, notwithstanding the peculiarities of the structure of medieval and early modern music manuscripts. In this paper I will examine the organisation of complex music manuscripts, discussing the concepts of codicological unit, modularity, and blocks as applied in particular to manuscripts transmitting polyphonic music compiled in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. I will show how these manuscripts offer a unique set of problems when it comes to the description of their complex structure. Finally, I will discuss the challenges and the implications related to applying thess concepts when cataloguing and describing music manuscripts, with examples from the codices of the Fondo Cappella Sistina of the Vatican Library.

**Music in the _Libri Amicorum_ Between the 16th and 17th Centuries: An Investigation of an Important Source to be Rediscovered**  
The paper intends to investigate the _liber amicorum_ between the 16th and 17th centuries. The _liber_ is presented as a pocket diary that accompanied a student, traveller or pilgrim, and in which guests, usually friends or important people with whom the owner had come into contact, dedicated inscriptions. Such dedications could contain textual quotations, drawings, family coats of arms, riddles and even music. From a musical point of view, the _Stammbuch_ has only been studied in recent years. It has proved to be an important means not only to supplement the biographies of known musicians or to get to know those of unknown composers, but also to reconstruct the travels, movements and networks of relationships that were created around musical practice and knowledge, and to shed light on the educational strategies of university students between the 16th and 17th centuries. Thanks to RISM, much of the music in these sources has been recorded and catalogued, others not yet. With the present paper, I would like to take a closer look at the document type _liber amicorum_, so important for the history of music and musical thought, and try to take stock of the state of studies concerning it from a musical point of view and of the prospects for an investigation involving its detailed and, hopefully, complete cataloguing.
