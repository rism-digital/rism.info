# Publications on CD-ROM

## Series A/I: Individual prints before 1800

_Series A/I:_ _Individual Prints Before 1800_ was published in 2011 as a database on CD-ROM (Bärenreiter-Verlag, Kassel). The database includes the entries from volumes 1-9 and the new entries from volumes 11-14. Addenda and corrigenda to volumes 11-14 have been integrated into the original entries. Library sigla are adjusted to the forms currently used by RISM, and known changes in the holdings have been integrated. Composers' names are aligned to the usage in Series A/II. The database is accessible through a full text search, which saves the user the step of consulting an index, something unavoidable in the printed version.

In 2015, the contents of this CD-ROM were transferred to the free online catalog.

## Series A/II: Music Manuscripts after 1600

From 1995 to 2008, an annual cumulative CD-ROM edition of _Series A/II: Music Manuscripts after 1600_ was released (K.G. Saur Verlag GmbH, Munich). This had followed two microfiche editions from 1984 and 1985 (Bärenreiter-Verlag, Kassel). The CD-ROM offer has been discontinued.
