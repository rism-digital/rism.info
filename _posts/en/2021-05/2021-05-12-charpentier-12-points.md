It is [this manuscript](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=840024141&View=rism){:blank} that started it all—or more specifically, the first few bars of this page. The collection of autograph music by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1643-1704) gathered in a volume known as [_Mélanges autographes_, vol. 10](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001068787&View=rism){:blank}, contains the _Te Deum_ (H. 146), whose opening bars we have been hearing more and more as we count down to the [Eurovision Song Contest final on May 22](https://eurovision.tv/){:blank}. It has been a meteoric rise for a composer who went from being relatively obscure in the middle of the 20th century to someone whose melody is the official anthem of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).  

In the preface to [H. W. Hitchcock's Charpentier catalog published in 1982](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=lit3293&View=rism){:blank}, Norbert Dufourcq looks back on the development of Charpentier studies. He observes that after World War II, the dominance of Germanic composers in French scholarship had finally come to an end, paving the way to a full consideration of the composer's oeuvre. Modern studies on the composer emerged in the early 20th century, but even in 1945 Claude Crussard's monograph [labeled Charpentier a "forgotten composer"](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/177308512){:blank}. The post-war period saw fresh scholarship, concerts, recordings, and modern performing editions that brought Charpentier into the light and to the attention of people outside of France.  

Guy Lambert published a modern edition of the _Te Deum_ in 1943. A recording, using Lamber's edition, conducted by Louis Martini ([Erato, 1953](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k127483q){:blank}) won the [Grand Prix du Disque](https://books.google.de/books?id=lup4DwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT235&ots=_a_HZqmzFl&dq=%22eurovision%20and%20the%20ritual%20music%22&hl=de&pg=PT235#v=onepage&q=%22eurovision%20and%20the%20ritual%20music%22&f=false){:blank} and brought further attention to this work.

In 1954, the first 8 (or 16, if you repeat) measures of the Prelude to the _Te Deum_ made their debut as the EBU anthem, heard during the broadcast of a narcissus festival in Switzerland. It also, of course, heralded in the first iteration of the Song Contest two years later. It is still somewhat unclear how the piece came to the attention of the EBU; scholars sometimes point to Lambert's uncovering of the piece, [or maybe it was the BBC, or just a fortuitous discovery]( https://www.eurovision.de/feddersens_kommentar/Die-Eurovisonsmelodie-eine-Hymne-fuer-Europa,eurovisionshymne100.html){:blank}. [Thomas Betzwieser]( https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110479591/html){:blank} examined the EBU archives in Geneva but found no discussion of this piece linking it to an EBU decision; he suspects that the selection was made on a national level, which would point the search for relevant documentation to local archives.
