[A recent review](https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2020.73.2.397){:blank} of the book [_Plague and Music in the Renaissance_ by Remi Chiu](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316271476){:blank} caught our eye. Chiu looks at the different ways that music found expression during the time in history when the plague was basically a constant threat. Through the book was published in 2017, it takes on an unexpected relevance today.  

[Chiu includes an appendix](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316271476.009){:blank} of motets and madrigals addressed to specific saints, particularly St. Sebastian (protector against plague), prayer settings, and madrigals directly connected to the 1576-78 outbreak in Milan. Researchers using [the RISM catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:blank} to find music connected with plagues or other pandemics must also have on hand resources such as Chiu's book, or for example Christopher Macklin's appendix in his ["Plague, performance and the elusive history of the _Stella celi extirpavit_" (2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40800907){:blank}. Records in RISM index names of musical forms and people involved, but not topical terms of what a piece is about.  

Pieces cited by Chiu and Macklin can be found in RISM (insofar that we have them) by searching for the abbreviations [ChiuP 2017](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22lit50006433%22){:blank} and [MacklinS 2010](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22lit50006435%22){:blank}, respectively.  

If helpful books and articles about a particular pandemic are unavailable, then you have to rely on keyword searching: search for likely words (even archaic ones) that might appear in the piece's title, somewhere on the source itself, or added as a note by a cataloger.  

Using such a keyword search, you can find some music surrounding a cholera outbreak that raged through Berlin in 1831-32.  Fanny Hensel wrote a "Cholera Cantata" just a few weeks into the epidemic (image; [RISM ID no. 462003900](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=462003900&View=rism){:blank}). Hensel lost friends and family members during the cholera wave and her diary during this time reflects how it affected her life, [excerpts of which can be read here](https://wophil.org/fanny-mendelssohns-response-to-the-epidemic-of-1831/){:blank}.  

Hensel was not the only composer who reacted musically to the health crisis. [A search in the RISM catalog for "cholera"](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=cholera){:blank} finds other pieces that can be dated to this particular cholera outbreak: [a violin concerto](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=201009077&View=rism){:blank} possibly by Ludwig Wilhelm Maurer written during the "terrible time of cholera" and [a piece by Moritz Friedrich August Kähler](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=464121100&View=rism){:blank} for the benefit of children orphaned by the outbreak.  

Hensel's Cholera Cantata is performed here:
