[Polona](https://polona.pl/){:target="_blank"}, the digital library administered by the [National Library of Poland](http://bn.org.pl/en/){:target="_blank"}, has published its 2 millionth work and has just released an interface in English. (Look at the bottom of the page for a link to the English version.)

Polona includes treasures of Polish culture from the National Library and a number of other institutions. You can find books, old prints, manuscripts, graphics, maps, photographs, flyers, posters, postcards—and of course music. So far, over 12,000 music items are included.

**How do you find music?**  
Go to the main menu on the left and click on the [**Items**](https://polona.pl/items/?filters=public:1){:target="_blank"} panel.

For **printed music**, select the category "[scores](https://polona.pl/items/?filters=category:scores,public:1,hasTextContent:0){:target="_blank"}" — the button with a music note.

For **music manuscripts**, select the category "[manuscripts](https://polona.pl/items/?filters=category:manuscripts,public:1,hasTextContent:0){:target="_blank"}" — the button showing a page with writing — and further select the genre "[rękopisy muzyczne](https://polona.pl/items/?filters=category:manuscripts,metatype:r%C4%99kopisy_muzyczne,public:1,hasTextContent:0){:target="_blank"}" (music manuscripts).

High-resolution images are available and items in the public domain may be reused without asking for permission.
