The series RISM A-Z is moving on to the letter C, which today stands for the Baroque composer and performer Francesca Caccini (1587-c.1640). She was a _musica_ in the Medici court in Florence from 1607 to 1627 and from 1633 to 1641: a composer, singer, instrumentalist, voice teacher, and concert organizer. In this position, she composed for the stage as well as for chamber ensembles. Most of her 17 theatrical works were performed at the court and she is thought to have composed hundreds of smaller vocal works. Today she is remembered as the first woman to have composed an opera--though at the time, it was called a _balletto_: _La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina_ (1625).

Unusually for a professional woman musician at the time, both the opera and her _Primo Libro_ of vocal songs were published during her lifetime. RISM A/I lists both of these:

- _Il primo libro delle musiche a una, e due voci_<sup> </sup> (Firenze, Zanobi Pignoni, 1618)
RISM A/I: C 2 (4 locations)
- _La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina. Balletto ... rappresentata nel Poggio Imperiale, villa della Serenissima Arciducessa d'Austria Gran Ducessa di Toscana_ (Firenze, Pietro Cecconcelli, 1625)
A/I: C 3 (6 copies)


A [digitized copy](http://imslp.org/wiki/Primo_Libro_della_Musiche_%28Caccini,_Francesca%29){:target="_blank"} of the _Primo Libro_ held by the Biblioteca Estense in Modena (I-MOe) can be found on IMSLP.

The RISM online database lists [seven excerpts from](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=liberazione "external-link-new-window")_[La liberazione](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=liberazione "external-link-new-window")_ that are preserved in Rome. These copies date from the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. For two choruses, "[O bei pensieri volate](http://opac.rism.info/search?id=853000787&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}" and "[Tosche del sol più belle tosche](http://opac.rism.info/search?id=853002122&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}," no fewer than 109 parts exist. They are preserved in a collection along with excerpts from operas by Cherubini, Gluck, and Rossini. This gives you an idea of how the choruses might have been performed in the hands of their previous owners at the Società Musicale Romana.

Below are highlights of a performance of _La liberazione_ from the Australian premiere in 2012.
