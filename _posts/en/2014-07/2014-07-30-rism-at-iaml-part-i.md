The [International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres (IAML)](http://www.iaml.info/){:target="_blank"}, a co-sponsor of RISM, held its annual meeting in Antwerp, Belgium from 13-18 July 2014. Members of three national groups presented during the RISM Open Session.

**Marie Cornaz (RISM Belgium, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, Brussels)**
RISM in Belgium – past and present

Marie Cornaz gave a very detailed report about the situation in Belgium. Many important collections have not yet been cataloged in RISM. She will try to get RISM projects started at these libraries. Currently, there are over 35,000 sources from [Belgium in RISM](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=B-*){:target="_blank"} from 27 institutions.

**Hildegard Herrmann‐Schneider (RISM Tirol‐Südtirol & OFM Austria, [Institut für Tiroler Musikforschung](http://www.musikland-tirol.at/index.php){:target="_blank"}, Innsbruck**

Fr. Hartmann von An der Lan‐Hochbrunn OFM (1863‐1914): A Tyrolean Franciscan as a cosmopolitan musician and music history phenomenon

This report was a fascinating biography of Father Hartmann, a composer and musician who was once called--next to Winston Churchill--one of the “Männer vom Tage” by a German newspaper in 1913. There are 114 pieces by [Father Hartmann in the RISM database](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Hartmann+von+An){:target="_blank"} and 9 pieces of ephemera.

**André Guerra Cotta (RISM Brazil, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro)**

Report on the First Brazilian Seminar of the Project Répertoire Internationale des Sources Musicales (RISM)

André Guerra Cotta traveled to Belgium just for IAML and reported on a conference that included a workshop on how to catalog sources using RISM standards. He also summarized the current activities of RISM Brazil. Currently, the RISM database only has sources from the [Laboratório de Musicologio do Departamento de Música da Escola de Comunicação e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo (BR-SPeca)](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=BR-SPeca){:target="_blank"}.

Below is Father Hartmann's _Coro trionfale_ for organ, Felix Bräuer, organ.
