The RISM online catalog already knows the answer! Take a look at [_Koning voetbal (King soccer)_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=702011485&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}. Willi Schootemeijer was inspired by a match between the Netherlands and Belgium in 1934 and wrote this march. _Koning voetbal_ is the most famous of his ca. 50 marches.

RISM unfortunately does not have an incipit for this piece, so we will throw this question to the Oranje fans: Who can confirm for us that this recording of _Koning voetbal_ with the Harmonie Orkest Roosendaal from 2 July 2010 is the same work?

Here you can listen to Schootemeijer's song _Ik hou van Holland_ sung by Joseph Schmidt:
