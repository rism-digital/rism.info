RISM will be conducting user studies at the IAML conference in Antwerp in order to learnwhat people think about the [online catalog of musical sources](http://opac.rism.info/){:target="_blank"} and what search strategies are used so that we can improve our services.

Whether you are a music librarian or a student, a database pro or just someone with casual knowledge of RISM, we are interested in what you think.

You are invited to visit us in the exhibits area, or we can arrange to meet at a different time and place during the conference. We will be carrying out our user studies again in the fall, so if you will not be in Antwerp, there will still be opportunities to participate later.
