For many, "Pentecost" (Whitsun) and "music" call to mind the striking setting of the Pentecost hymn _Veni Creator Spiritus_ in Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony. A look in the RISM database shows the versatile musical forms the text has taken. The [1,276 RISM records](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&title=Veni+creator+spiritus){:target="_blank"} range from Heinrich Finck (ca. 1444-1527), who is represented with two settings in the _Sacrorum hymnorum_ (Liber primus) from 1542 (RISM B/I: [1542|12](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000993104330){:target="_blank"}), to Joseph Haas (1879-1960), whose autograph manuscript from 1960 (RISM ID no. [456081224](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=456081224)) is in RISM. Sources are especially abundant by the composers Franz Xaver Witt (36x) and Victor Eder (34x).

The Pentecost sequence _[Veni Sancte Spiritus](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&title=Veni+sancte+spiritus){:target="_blank"}_ has been set to music even more often than the Pentecost hymn. In RISM, there are over 1,600 sources, with many by Niccolò Jommelli and Michael Haydn. Haydn's setting in E-flat major (MH 366) was especially popular and is preserved in manuscripts in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Switzerland.

Other music manuscripts concerning Pentecost – a total of 4,341 – can be found when you do an [Advanced Search](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism&SearchType=2&Language=en){:target="_blank"} and select the field **Liturgical festival**. Enter **Pentecostes**. From there, you will see that you can also search for other music relating to the Pentecost season, such as Pentecost Monday (Whit Monday): **pentecostes, feria ii**.
