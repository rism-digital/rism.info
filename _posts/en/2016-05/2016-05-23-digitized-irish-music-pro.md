_The following was originally published by the [Research Foundation for Music in Ireland](http://www.musicresearch.ie/?q=irishmusiccollection){:target="_blank"} and is reprinted here with kind permission:_

The library of the DIT Conservatory of Music & Drama has a specialised collection of the music composed in Ireland, about Ireland and by Irish composers which has developed through generous donations and bequests.

The collection has been digitised by the library to preserve, provide access to and promote the dynamic musical life of Ireland. Considerable research has been carried out to provide access to the digitized materials within the parameters of copyright legislation. Images of materials outside of copyright are freely available online to view and use; materials within copyright are available online for the use of Dublin Institute of Technology staff and students. The original materials are available to view in the library by anyone on request.

The collection features works by prominent Irish composers of the early twentieth-century including Carl Hardebeck (1869-1945), Eamonn O Gallchobhair (1906-1982), Robert O Dwyer (1862-1949), Charles Villiers Stanford (1852-1924) and Ernest De Regge (1901-1958). Most of the material was published by the Dublin music publishers active during the nineteenth and twentieth-centuries, including the fledgling Oifig an tSolathair (the Stationary Office, run by the Irish government) and the Gaelic Press which produced mainly nationalist music based around the independence movement.

The catalogue of these digitized scores can be found[here](http://library.dit.ie/search/?searchtype=d&SORT=D&searcharg=digitized+irish+music-). This is a project in progress and new materials will appear online on an ongoing basis.
