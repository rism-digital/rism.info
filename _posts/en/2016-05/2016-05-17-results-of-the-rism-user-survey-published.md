We are pleased to present the results of the RISM catalog survey, available on the RISM Survey page:

[The RISM Online User Survey: Report](/community/survey-2014-2015.html#c3127) (May 2016; also available in German)

The survey was conducted from October 30, 2014 until February 28, 2015. We received a total of 551 responses from people around the world.

This was the first survey that RISM has ever carried out. Having received so many responses from users around the world, we were pleasantly surprised by the resonance of the survey and the care people took in recording their opinions. The survey offered insight into the people who use the online catalog and feedback on both the catalog and the services RISM provides in relation to it.

We learned more about who you are, dear catalog users, and what your experiences and expectations are. We implemented many of your suggestions immediately, from simple adjustments to the help text to correcting errors that were reported. Your feedback is steering the next development of the online catalog (which is underway right now) and helping to develop a comprehensive set of tutorials and other instructional aids to make the most of the RISM online catalog. The data in this survey will be analyzed further to ensure that we offer optimal services for different types of users.

We would like to thank everyone who took the time to fill out the survey. If you ever have any questions or comments about RISM or this survey, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info).
