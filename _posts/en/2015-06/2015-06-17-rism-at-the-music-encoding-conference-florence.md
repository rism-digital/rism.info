I (Jennifer Ward) attended the [Music Encoding Conference](http://music-encoding.org/conference){:target="_blank"} in Florence, Italy, from 18-20 May 2015. The [full program](https://music-encoding.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MEC2015_program.pdf){:target="_blank"} included 19 presentations and 11 poster sessions.

The Music Encoding Conference was organized by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), a scholarly community whose main project is creating musical documents that are machine-readable. MEI has been used in many projects, including the [Lost Voices Project](/electronic_resources/2014/11/20/the-lost-voices-project-is-now-live.html){:target="_blank"} and [Beethovens Werkstatt](/electronic_resources/2015/05/04/a-peek-inside-beethovens-workshop.html){:target="_blank"}, which we reported on in this space, and the latter of which was at the conference.

It was interesting to hear about ways in which RISM data were being used in various projects, since the data are available as [linked open data](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=8&L=1){:target="_blank"} under a CC license. At RISM Switzerland, for example, our colleagues Rodolfo Zitellini and Laurent Pugin are working on expressing MARC with MEI. Here they hope to make the data more visible behind MARC, since not everyone can "read" MARC records. They have a demo of converting [Plaine & Easie code](http://www.iaml.info/plaine-easie-code){:target="_blank"} to MEI on [Verovio.org](http://www.verovio.org/pae-examples.xhtml){:target="_blank"}.

A paper by Kristina Richts and Irmlind Capelle reported on the [Detmold Court Theatre Project](http://hoftheater-detmold.de/){:target="_blank"}, an aim of which is to determine whether MEI is a viable means of cataloging music manuscripts (and they are using TEI, the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml){:target="_blank"}, to encode archival text documents such as lists of artists' fees and account books). For the manuscripts, they have taken RISM records and are adding information to expand on details only hinted at in RISM, such as crossed-out sections or differences in partbooks. It is hoped that the enhanced RISM data can be sent back to the RISM catalog after the conclusion of this project, but exact details still need to be worked out. For those going to the [IAML congress in New York](http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/BlankCustom.asp?page=IAML_IMS_2015){:target="_blank"}, Richts and Peter Stadler will describe the workflow in more detail at the [RISM session](/events/2015/06/15/imsiaml-congress-in-new-york-june-2015.html){:target="_blank"} on Thursday, June 25.

Research by Stadler and Richts appeared in a different constellation in a presentation about a digital thematic catalog of Carl Maria von Weber’s works. Slides are [available online](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33605578/richts-stadler-slides-mec2015.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The [Max Reger Institute](http://www.max-reger-institut.de/de/index.php){:target="_blank"} was also present to discuss the hybrid edition of Max Reger’s organ works, with close attention to manuscripts and early printed editions. We also heard about updates from the [Josquin Research Project](http://josquin.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} by Craig Stuart Sapp and Jesse Rodin, and ways of using MEI for lute music by David Lewis, Richard Lewis, and Tim Crawford. The MEI customizations for Transforming Musicology are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/TransformingMusicology/mei-tmus){:target="_blank"}. Giuliano Di Bacco and Perry Roland are looking into MEI for mensural notation in the [Thesaurus musicarum latinarum project](http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/start.html){:target="_blank"} at Indiana University. So many of the presentations at this conference seemed to touch on areas that RISM focuses on, and I hope that we can increase our cooperation with projects like these in the future.
