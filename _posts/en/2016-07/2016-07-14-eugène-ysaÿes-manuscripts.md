Belgian composer and violin virtuoso Eugène Ysaÿe (1858- 1931) was born 158 years ago this Saturday. Those looking for manuscript sources for Ysaÿe should look no further than the [Royal Library of Belgium](http://www.kbr.be/){:target="_blank"} ([B-Br](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=B-Br){:target="_blank"}). The [Fonds Eugène Ysaÿe](http://www.kbr.be/collections/musique/patrimoine/fonds/ysaye_fr.html){:target="_blank"} contains 161 autograph manuscripts and 1,083 printed scores (by Ysaÿe as well as other composers), as well as other printed works, hundreds of autograph letters, sound recordings, images, and film reels. A [virtual exhibition](http://ysaye.kbr.be/){:target="_blank"} was made in 2008.

The newest addition to the collection arrived in 2014, when the Royal Library acquired the autograph manuscript of [_Légende norvégienne_](/rediscovered/2014/04/11/légende-norvégienne-unknown-work-by-the-belgian.html){:target="_blank"}. This work had previously been completely unknown and is not listed in the composer's works list in _Grove Music Online_. Written in 1882 when the composer was touring in Norway, _Légende norvégienne_ was premiered just two days after the date on the manuscript. While in Norway, Ysaÿe met Edvard Grieg. This past April, the [Edvard Grieg Museum](http://griegmuseum.no/en/concerts/norwegian-legend){:target="_blank"} organized the first performance of the piece in Bergen since Ysaÿe played it himself there 134 years ago.

The RISM online catalog currently has just one piece by Ysaÿe, an autograph score of _Poème élégiaque_dedicated to [Gabriel Fauré](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Gabriel+Faur%C3%A9){:target="_blank"} (RISM ID no. [700011088](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=700011088){:target="_blank"}). [RISM Belgium](/workgroups/belgium-rism-belgium.html) is working on adding more from the Fonds Eugène Ysaÿe.

Another significant collection is the [Eugène Ysaÿe Collection](https://www.juilliard.edu/school/library-and-archives/special-collections){:target="_blank"} at The Juilliard School in New York ([US-NYj](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=US-NYj){:target="_blank"}), which holds autograph manuscripts for solo violin sonatas no. 2, 3, and 6.
