The RISM Editorial Center wishes you all the best for a festive holiday season, fittingly with a historical document: an early (1863) edition of "Silent Night," John Freeman Young's English translation of Joseph Mohr's "Stille Nacht" as set to music by Franz Xaver Gruber.

We wish you many a silent night in the coming days and weeks, and would like to thank you for your interest in our work and, in particular, for your valuable contributions that help us improve our service day by day.

P.S. You can find extensive information about the original "Stille Nacht" song (composed in 1818) in [volume 15 of the _Denkm√§ler der Musik in Salzburg_ series](https://www.stillenacht.at/assets/files/media/stille-nacht/Stille-Nacht.-Die-Autographe.pdf){:blank}.
