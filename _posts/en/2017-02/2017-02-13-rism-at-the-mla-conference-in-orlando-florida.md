The annual [Music Library Association conference](http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/mpage/mla_2017){:target="_blank"} (US branch of [IAML](http://www.iaml.info/){:target="_blank"}) will be held from 22-26 February 2017 in sunny Orlando, Florida. This conference will be the first [Pan American regional IAML meeting](http://www.iaml.info/news/mla-goes-pan-american){:target="_blank"} and many of our colleagues from the entire Latin American region will be in attendance.

The timing of the conference is especially fitting given the conference [Documenting Musical Sources in Latin America](/publications/conferences/latin-america-conference-2016.html#c3287) that we hosted this past September. The MLA conference is therefore an excellent opportunity to reconnect with our Latin American colleagues and share information about the state of source documentation in the region.

Some sessions will be streamed online. Access to both the live and archived streams [may be purchased from MLA](https://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/events/EventDetails.aspx?id=910275){:target="_blank"}.

Please stop by these RISM sessions, both on Friday, February 24:

Sarah Adams and Christina Linklater from the US RISM office will give a brief presentation on [Muscat](/community/muscat.html){:target="_blank"}, our browser-based, open-access program for cataloging and reporting musical sources, including manuscripts, printed music, libretti, and treatises. This lightening-fast session will include a demonstration of the tool and some important points about training and documentation.

**Hands-on Muscat Cataloging**

- Friday, February 24, Mezzanine Balcony, 3:30-4:00pm

This will be your big opportunity to actually make some RISM records in Muscat, using the training version of the database. Christina and Sarah will be on hand to guide you around Muscat, which can be easily viewed and used on laptops and tablets using Chrome or Firefox.

In addition, Christina will be around to meet up for a quick Muscat demo if you can't make the above sessions.
