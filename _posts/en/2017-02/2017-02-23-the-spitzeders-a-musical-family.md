If you search for "Spitzeder" online, you'll first stumble upon a lot of websites related to the actress Adele Spitzeder (1832-1895; image left). She has a musical tie-in (later in life she performed popular songs as the singer Adele Vio), but today she is more infamous than famous for founding the Spitzeder Private Bank. As a money lender, she used a pyramid scheme to defraud 31,000 customers of 8 million guldens and was sentenced to three years in jail.

Adele Spitzeder came from a long line of musicians, however. Six of her relatives have sources in the RISM database:

Tenor Franz Anton Spitzeder (1735-1796) was active in Salzburg as a singer as well as a piano and voice teacher. His name appears as a performer on a libretto of Mozart's _Die Schuldigkeit des Ersten Gebots_ (RISM ID no. [653005629](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=653005629&Language=en){:target="_blank"}).

His brother Oswald Spitzeder (1738-1783) is so far only known in RISM as the owner of a _Litaniae Lauretanae_ by Anton Cajetan Adlgasser (RISM ID no. [659000020](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=659000020&Language=en){:target="_blank"}).

Franz Anton's son Johann Baptist Spitzeder (1764-1842) can be found on four sources from Weimar, including as a performer in Carl Friedrich Zelter's setting of Friedrich Schiller's _Dithyrambe_ (RISM ID no. [250002099](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=250002099&Language=en){:target="_blank"}). The well-traveled bass and actor also performed in numerous opera houses, including in Bonn, Munich, and Vienna.

Another one of Franz Anton's sons is Joseph Spitzeder (1767-1842), who was active in Nuremberg and Vienna and should not be confused with his nephew Josef Spitzeder (1796-1832; the father of Adele). Adalbert Gyrowetz composed an aria for Joseph in the opera _Der lustige Schuster_ (RISM ID no. [464111140](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=464111140&Language=en){:target="_blank"}).

Adelheid Fries (1793-1873) was the daughter of Johann Baptist Spitzeder and performed in the opera _Garibaldi der Agilofinger_ in 1824 (RISM ID no. [455020427](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=455020427&Language=en){:target="_blank"}).

Henriette Spitzeder-Schüler (1800-1828) was the daughter of the singer Carl Schüler (1775-1809) and married Josef Spitzeder in 1816. During her short life, she could be heard in numerous opera houses, including the ones in Karlsruhe, Nuremberg, and Vienna. A guest performance took her to Hamburg in 1826, where she sang in Etienne-Nicolas Méhul's opera _La Journée aux Aventures_ (RISM ID no. [452502383](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=452502383&Language=en){:target="_blank"}). She died in 1828 giving birth to her tenth child.
