The [manuscript tablatures and partbooks of the Bavarian State Library (BSB)](http://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/index.html?c=sammlung&projekt=1448525517&l=en){:target="_blank"} up to the seventeenth century are, in addition to early printed music and choirbooks, the third and final type of universal music collection owned by the dukes of Bavaria in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The collection includes two groups of manuscripts, which are linked by their origin and their contents: vocal partbooks and tablatures with instrumental music.

In contrast to the choirbooks with their almost exclusively sacred works, this collection includes mainly secular music such as chansons, songs, madrigals, and dances, with motets and intabulations of masses as well.

The aims of the project, which is funded by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), are to index in detail the BSB's tablature manuscripts and partbooks up to the seventeenth century, digitize them, and make them available online.

Digitization and cataloguing will enable the scholarly exploration of the collection online.

The picture shows the manuscript D-Mbs, Mus.ms. 263, fol. 35v, Benediktinerkloster Irsee?, ca. 1600-1605, with an intabulations by Jacob Reiner (ca. 1560â€“1606) _Cantate Domino canticum novum_ in 6 voices.
