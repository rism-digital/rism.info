The [Web Library of Seventeenth-Century Music](http://www.sscm-wlscm.org/){:target="_blank"} (WLSCM) is a project sponsored by the [Society for Seventeenth-Century Music](http://www.sscm-sscm.org/){:target="_blank"}. It is a free collection of peer-reviewed, scholarly publications of seventeenth-century compositions that are not commercially available in print and have not been posted online. A separate series, [Monuments of Seventeenth-Century Music](http://www.sscm-wlscm.org/monuments-of-seventeenth-century-music){:target="_blank"}, is for anthologies or large collections of music, frequently drawing from multiple sources. Editions may be downloaded, printed, and performed in non-profit settings.

[WLSCM's catalog](http://www.sscm-wlscm.org/main-catalogue/full-catalogue-list){:target="_blank"}already contains 29 titles. Users can browse the collection or search by editor, genre, language, scoring, or composer. The library's most recent edition is [_Zwölff Madrigalische Trost=Gesänge_](http://www.sscm-wlscm.org/main-catalogue/browse-by-composer/363-zwoelff-madrigalische-trost-gesaenge){:target="_blank"}(1670/71) by Wolfgang Carl Briegel, edited by Gregory S. Johnston. The edition is based on a source at the Zentralbibliothek in Zürich (CH-Zz, AMS XIII 531), the only library that documents a complete set of parts according to the RISM online catalog (RISM A/I: B 4479, [RISM ID no. 990007092](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000990007092){:target="_blank"}). The introduction gives more information about the sources, as well as historical information about the composer a critical report.
