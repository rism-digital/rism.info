Last Sunday, May 29, 2016, RISM honorary president Christoph Wolff was honored with the medal [Pour le Mérit für Wissenschaften und Künste](http://www.orden-pourlemerite.de/){:target="_blank"}, a civilian honor. In the presence of German President Joachim Gauck, the Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim and the German musicologist Christoph Wolff received their medals at a ceremony in Berlin. The medal, awarded since 1842 "for services to the arts and sciences," may only be held at any one time by no more than 40 men and women in Germany and 40 abroad, recognizing the achievements of scientists, scholars, and artists.
