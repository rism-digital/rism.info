As in years past, RISM will be sponsoringsessions. In addition, several of our RISM colleagues will be presenting on topics that relate to RISM and musical sources, demonstrating how RISM is used to locate musical sources and how they use this information in libraries and performances.

- 7–Organs in Roman Churches
Oratorio del Crocifisso, Piazza dell’Oratorio
Presentation of the organ (1744) by Johann Konrad Wörle/Giovanni Corrado Verlè (1701 Vils – 1777 Rome)

Florian Bassani, Organ (Universität Bern, Institut für Musikwissenschaft)
P. Urban Stillhard OSB, P. Ulrich Kössler OSB (Schola Benedictina, Muri-Gries Abbey, Bozen/South Tyrol)
Hildegard Herrmann-Schneider (RISM Tirol-Südtirol & OFM Austria/Institut für Tiroler Musikforschung)

The organ, built in 1744 by one of the best eighteenth-century organ builders in Rome (who had immigrated from Austria), is in the sacred room in which the oratorio as a music genre began. The Oratorio del Crocifisso is completely decorated with frescos by representative artists from Rome ca. 1580/90 and otherwise rarely open to visitors.

After a short introduction to the instrument and room, the Wörle organ will be sounded live in a short concert with eighteenth-century repertoire from Rome, held by libraries in Rome (Biblioteca dell’Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei e Corsiniana [I-Rli] and Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale [I-Rn]), including works by Girolamo Chiti (director of music at the Basilika S. Giovanni in Laterano from 1726) and anonymous _alternatim_ pieces.
