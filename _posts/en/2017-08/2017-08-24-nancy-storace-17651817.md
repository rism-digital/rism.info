Nancy Storace (1765-1817) was a celebrated English soprano, perhaps most famous for originating the role of Susanna in [Mozart's _Le nozze di Figaro_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=400187519){:target="_blank"}. Storace—and there is evidently no consensus whether to pronounce her name the English or the Italian way—was in the [headlines](http://www.mozarteum.at/start/meldung/283){:target="_blank"} [last year](http://in.reuters.com/article/czech-mozart-idINKCN0VP1Q2){:target="_blank"} when a long-lost joint composition by Mozart, Salieri, and a Cornetti turned up at the [Czech Museum of Music](http://opac.nm.cz/opaccmh/documents/63005){:target="_blank"} in Prague (Národní muzeum - České muzeum hudby, hudebně-historické oddělení, CZ-Pnm). "[Per la recuperata salute di Ophelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_la_ricuperata_salute_di_Ofelia){:target="_blank"}" (KV 477a) was jointly written for Storace to celebrate her return to health in 1785.

Before she was a star on stage in Vienna, Storace had been a child prodigy in England and was taught by the famous castrato Venanzio Rauzzini. At the age of 13, she and her composer brother, Stephen, went to their father's Italian homeland, where she launched her operatic career. While in Italy, the Storace siblings met Michael Kelly, who became a lifelong friend—Kelly frequently mentions Nancy in his [_Reminiscences_](https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofm01kellrich#page/94/mode/2up/search/nancy){:target="_blank"}. Storace saw Kelly again in Vienna, where she was engaged at the Italian opera and where she performed roles by Mozart, Salierei, and others that were especially written for her. (Storace and Kelly even appear on the same manuscript for Paisiello's _[Il re Teodoro in Venezia](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=450058030){:target="_blank"}_, which premiered in Vienna in 1784). She was so beloved as a singer that her return to the stage in 1785 after a months-long hiatus was indeed a cause for celebration.

After a decade on the continent, Storace went back to England and performed in her brother's operas. It is within this context that Nancy's name appears in the RISM database—as a performer in works by [Stephen Storace](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Stephen+Storace){:target="_blank"}. Since the 200th anniversary of her death is today, let's turn our eye to music associated with her in RISM.

The best way to see sources where she is named by doing an **[Advanced search](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism&SearchType=2&Language=en){:target="_blank"}** and selecting the field **Other names**. The [manuscript sources for her](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=nancy+storace&Language=en){:target="_blank"} are mostly in the United Kingdom at the National Library of Wales (GB-AB). The operas in RISM where she is named as a performer include:

- _The Haunted Tower_ (1789)
- _No Song, No Supper_ (1790)
- _The Siege of Belgrade_ (1791)
- _The Pirates_ (1792)
- _My Grandmother_ (1793)
- _The Iron Chest_ (1796)
- _Mahmoud_ (1796)

_The Haunted Tower_ was Storace's debut role in English opera. This part of her career intersected once more with that of Michael Kelly, who created many of the roles in Stephen's operas, including [_The Pirates_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=806519130){:target="_blank"}. Stephen Storace died in 1796, and Nancy and Michael Kelly collaborated to help bring his last opera _[Mahmoud](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=806519279){:target="_blank"}_ to the stage.

The indication **Performer** in RISM does not only mean "singer." Nancy Storace also danced on occasion. [John A. Rice tells us](https://books.google.de/books?id=8YOwT4hOUQAC&lpg=PA373&dq=%22Storace%20danced%20her%20favourite%20air%22&pg=PA373#v=onepage&q=%22Storace%20danced%20her%20favourite%20air%22&f=false){:target="_blank"} that after a performance of _The Siege of Belgrade_ in 1791, it was reported in the press that "Storace danced her favourite air with much grace—it was encored." This accomplishment as a dancer found its way into the printed minuet from the opera: "The favorite minuet, with variations for the piano forte or harpsichord as danced by Sig|a Storace" ([RISM A/I: S 6895](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000990063176){:target="_blank"}).

A sense of Nancy Storace's acclaimed voice that inspired the greatest works of many composers can be gleaned from listening to the music. Here is a [lullaby from _The Pirates_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=806519122){:target="_blank"}, in a recording sung by Bethany Beardslee:
