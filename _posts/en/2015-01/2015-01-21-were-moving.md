Goodbye, Sophienstraße! We're moving!

After 26 years of being in our office at Sophienstraße 26, we moving...about half a mile away to a building on the Goethe Universität Frankfurt campus.

As of Monday, January 26, 2015, our new mailing address will be:

RISM Zentralredaktion
Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität
Campus Bockenheim
Senckenberganlage 31-33
60325 Frankfurt am Main
Germany

For visitors, the address is:

Mertonstraße, Hauptgebäude (Bauteil D), rooms 401 – 407 ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/20PHH){:target="_blank"})

Please be patient as we sort out everything during the move. We expect to be back to business by the middle of next week.

We've enjoyed hosting people from around the world here and we're looking forward to welcoming you soon in our new office.
