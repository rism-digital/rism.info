_This announcement has reached us from Armin Brinzing, director of the [BibliothecaMozartiana](http://www.mozarteum.at/wissenschaft/bibliothek/bibliotheca-mozartiana.html){:target="_blank"} at the [Mozarteum](http://www.mozarteum.at/){:target="_blank"} in Salzburg:_

Thanks to the generous support of a private donor, the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation has been able to acquire an extensive autograph manuscript by Mozart. The manuscript is a copy of a work by Eugenio di Ligniville in the hands of Wolfgang and Leopold Mozart, which was in a private collection until now. The original autograph will be on display in the [Mozart Residence](http://www.mozarteum.at/museen/mozart-wohnhaus.html){:target="_blank"} during the Salzburg Festival.

For more information, please see the [Mozarteum website](http://www.mozarteum.at/en/content/news/256){:target="_blank"}.
