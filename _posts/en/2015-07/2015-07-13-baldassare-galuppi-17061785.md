The 2014/2015 opera and theater season is wrapping up, so let's take the opportunity to combine our series RISM A-Z with a current production.

On June 20, the opera _Alessandro nell'Indie_ by Baldassare Galuppi (libretto by Pietro Metastasio) premiered at the [Mainfranken-Theater in Würzburg](https://www.theaterwuerzburg.de/index.php?option=com_mftplayground&view=play&play_id=984&Itemid=116){:target="_blank"}. The last performance is tomorrow, July 14.

The RISM online catalog has 33 sources for this opera. Most of the sources are individual arias. Complete scores can be found in the [Bayerische Staatsbibliothek](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=456009041){:target="_blank"} and the [Library of Congress](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900011012){:target="_blank"}.

Among the RISM sources are also two contrafacta: Erissena's aria "Son confusa pastorella" became a sacred cantata with the text "Salve regina" (RISM ID no.[455007568](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=455007568){:target="_blank"}). In one source from Prague, Poro's aria "Vedrai con tuo periglio" was later set with the texts "Beata es virgo Maria" and "Stupesce in verbum patris" (RISM ID no. [550248720](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=550248720){:target="_blank"}).
