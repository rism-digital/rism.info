Thanks to the efforts of our colleagues in other countries, two events will enable the close study of musical sources: a workshop and an internship.

[**Muscat Workshop**](/community/muscat.html#c3432)
**Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina
March 25-29, 2019**

This workshop is being hosted by Leonardo Waisman and the Grupo de Musicología Histórica Córdoba with the Secretaría de Investigación y Producción de la Facultad de Artes, UNC. The workshop is directed at musicians, musicologists, librarians, and archivists. This workshop will also support the new RISM project in Córdoba that is focusing on sources in the Archivo Histórico Convento San Jorge ([RA-Ccsj](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22ks51001614%22&Language=en){:target="_blank"}) and the library of the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Facultad de Filosofía y Humanidades, Biblioteca "Elma Kohlmeyer de Estrabou" ([RA-Cff](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22ks51000008%22&Language=en){:target="_blank"}). Information in Spanish [is available here](http://artes.unc.edu.ar/primer-seminario-argentino-de-capacitacion-en-catalogacion-musical-con-muscat-rism/){:target="_blank"}.

**Internship: Musicology: Past and Present
I Tatti, Harvard University, Florence, Italy
June-July 2019; application deadline: March 1, 2019**

The focus of this internship is on the rich holdings of the Morrill Music Library, Biblioteca Berenson ([I-Fb](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do;jsessionid=6A8D39A7A923D2A7A28903E0DEF1BC98.touch01?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22ks30004727%22&Language=en){:target="_blank"}), of the Villa I Tatti in Florence, Italy. The strength of this library lies in Western music before 1640. In addition to gaining expertise in the use of musicological tools, interns will compare I Tatti's historical musical sources with RISM and ensure that they are accurately reflected in the database.
