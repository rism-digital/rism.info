**Happy New Year!**

As in past years, we would like to take a look at musical anniversaries for the next twelve months. The people whose birthdays or anniversaries of death we mark are not only composers but they can also be librettists, performers, dedicatees, or people who are in other ways connected to a musical source. They were born or died in a year ending in 19 or 69.

This year, there are over 1,000 of them and now the lists include a direct link to the relevant sources in the [RISM catalog](https://opac.rism.info/){:target="_blank"}.
