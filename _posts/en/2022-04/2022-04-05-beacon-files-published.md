As part of its efforts to provide its users with ever more interfaces, the Bavarian State Library is now offering RISM authority data in BEACON format. Such Beacon files are meant to link external data providers with RISM references. The linking element is the identifier of an authority data provider, e.g. GND ([Gemeinsame Normdatei](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html;jsessionid=2917FF4E4B3EB93749EEE9E41B474AF2.intranet261){:blank}) or VIAF ([Virtual International Authority File](https://viaf.org/){:blank}).

The Beacon files are simply structured text files that list available authority files in plain and readable form. Data providers can automatically create links on the respective websites, e.g. to display the music sources related in RISM to a given person.

The Beacon files are available [here](https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/data), and offer links to persons and institutions as sorted in two groups (according to GND and VIAF, respectively). We hope that this new offer can contribute to the further dissemination and use of RISM data.
