As part of its efforts to provide its users with ever more technical tools, the Bavarian State Library is now offering RISM authority data in BEACON format. Such BEACON files serve to link external data providers with RISM references. The linking element is the identifier of an authority data provider, e.g. GND ([Gemeinsame Normdatei](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html;jsessionid=2917FF4E4B3EB93749EEE9E41B474AF2.intranet261){:blank}) or VIAF ([Virtual International Authority File](https://viaf.org/){:blank}).

The BEACON files are simply structured text files that list available authority files in plain and readable form. Data providers can automatically create links on their websites, such as to display the music sources in RISM related to a given person.

The BEACON files are available [here](https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/data), and include links to personal names and institutions in separate files for both GND and VIAF. We hope that this new feature can contribute to the further dissemination and use of RISM data.
