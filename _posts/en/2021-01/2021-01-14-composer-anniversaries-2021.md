**Happy New Year!**

As in past years, we are using the beginning of the year to look at significant anniversaries of birth or death for people found in the [RISM catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:blank}. We are listing not only composers in RISM, but also librettists, performers, and dedicatees, or also people who are in other ways connected to a musical source. They were born or died in a year that ends in 21 or 71. 

The [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8w5AyN-PQvL6iO9nWS09wJDX9wohOEofgUI3OJkorw/edit?usp=sharing){:blank} is divided into two sheets, one for year of birth and one for year of death. You can sort by name, life dates, or gender, and we're also including a direct link to the [RISM catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:blank}.
