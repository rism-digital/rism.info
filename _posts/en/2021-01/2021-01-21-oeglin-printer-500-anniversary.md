The turn of the year 2020/2021 marks the 500th anniversary of the death of the first printer to print mensural music with movable type in Germany.

The Augsburg-based printer Erhard Öglin published a music book only six years after the Venetian pioneer Ottaviano Petrucci, and probably independently of him. A representative edition is _Melopoiae_, in folio format, which appeared in the first half of 1507 and contained odes by Horace ([RISM ID no. 990064739](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=990064739&View=rism){:blank}). Intended more for the eye than for practical use, this was followed by a small edition of these four-part settings for voice shortly thereafter, entitled _Harmonie_ ([RISM ID no. 990064740](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=990064740&View=rism){:blank}). The humanistically inclined initiators of the edition, Konrad Celtis and Konrad Peutinger, certainly chose Öglin because he was also a skilled type cutter and founder and could thus produce the music types himself. 

Five years later, in 1512, Öglin brought another novelty to the book market: the first polyphonic song collection with German words ([RISM ID no. 993103852](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=993103852&View=rism){:blank}). The publication appeared as four partbooks with woodcuts by Hans Burgkmair and contained secular repertoire from Emperor Maximilian's court chapel. Within a year he published another collection of songs ([RISM ID no. 993114941](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=993114941&View=rism){:blank}). 

Apart from a few broadsheets, nothing else from the field of music has survived from Öglin's workshop. Multiple-impression printing was too laborious to be profitable. However, he continued to print in Latin and German, and also published a Hebrew book. He died at the end of 1520 or in January 1521.
