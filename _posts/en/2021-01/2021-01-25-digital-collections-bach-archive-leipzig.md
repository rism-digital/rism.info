_We would like to share this announcement with you courtesy of the [Bach-Archiv Leipzig](https://www.bach-leipzig.de/de/bach-archiv){:blank}_:

To celebrate its 70th anniversary, in November 2020 the Bach Archive Leipzig launched a web portal that provides digital access to the archive's historical collections. At [digitalesammlungen.bach-leipzig.de](https://digitalesammlungen.bach-leipzig.de){:blank}, objects from the archive's collections and important permanent loans held by the Bach Archive are made available, including manuscripts from the St. Thomas Boys' Choir, the Peters Music Library (Leipziger Städtische Bibliotheken) and the publishing house Breitkopf & Härtel.

The digital objects are presented within the structure of their collections and include descriptions of the collection contexts. The high-resolution images can be downloaded and reused under an open license. In this way, the Bach Archive would like to make a contribution to the open provision of cultural data.
