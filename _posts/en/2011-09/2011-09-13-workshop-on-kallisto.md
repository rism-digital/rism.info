For describing musical sources, RISM has developed the database program Kallisto. It is offered to RISM working groups and individuals who want to contribute to the RISM database. Records made by means of the program will be added directly to the RISM online catalogue with the next update.

To familiarise participants with the program, the Zentralredaktion offers workshops on Kallisto. The next workshop will take place:

**Dates: October 4-6, 2011**

Begin: ca. 11:00 am on October 4
End: 5:00 pm on October 6
Place: **RISM Zentralredaktion in Frankfurt am Main**

This training session is intended for anyone **who wants to actively describe sources for RISM** with Kallisto. All types of cataloguing will be covered, such as describing individual pieces, collections, operas, compilations, and much more.

Please let us know by September 23 if you wish to attend.
We are happy to help you secure accommodation as well.
I would be pleased if many of you would attend this workshop.
