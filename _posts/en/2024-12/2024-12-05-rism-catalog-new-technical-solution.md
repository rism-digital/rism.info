A beta version of the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/rism/?lng=en){:blank} based on the open source discovery system VuFind was released in November 2023. At the same time, access to the existing online catalog was initially maintained.

On 9 December 2024, the old TouchPoint-based system will be discontinued permanently. The RISM Catalog now appears in a renewed design and its usability has been fundamentally improved. The new URL-based structure enables stable search sessions with easy forward and backward navigation as well as the permanent availability and citation of results. Minor improvements such as a country-based sorting of the print copies, a separate search entry for dates and an enhanced function for printing individual results have also been implemented as part of the migration.

Even after the end of the beta phase, the online service will be further developed on an ongoing basis.

The RISM Catalog is offered as part of the Specialized Information Service for Musicology ([musiconn](https://www.musiconn.de/){:blank}) at the Bavarian State Library. The project is funded by the German Research Foundation ([DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en){:blank}).
