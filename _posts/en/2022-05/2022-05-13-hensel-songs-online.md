_We have received the following from Tim Parker-Langston, editor of Hensel Songs Online:_

[Hensel Songs Online](https://henselsongsonline.org/){:blank} is an online resource that offers its users free access to the sheet music of Fanny Hensel's complete Lieder collection. Launched in Winter 2021, [the edition includes nearly a hundred songs](https://henselsongsonline.org/theedition){:blank} that had yet to be published and for the first time all the songs are readily available and transposed to suit different voice types. The resource is linked with the archives of the Berlin Staatsbibliothek so that users can see the original manuscripts used for the creation of the materials. Without [RISM](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22pe72637%22){:blank}, this edition would not exist, and Hensel's rich musical voice could have remained unheard for many years to come.
