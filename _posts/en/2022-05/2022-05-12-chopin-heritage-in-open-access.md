_We have received the following from the [Fryderyk Chopin Institute](https://nifc.pl/pl):_

30,000 photographs, 500 first editions of Chopin’s works, more than 3,000 issues of 19th-century magazines, almost 1,000 hours of recordings, manuscripts, works, Fryderyk Chopin’s correspondence, hundreds of iconographic objects and works of art – the largest Chopin collection in the world is now available online for free!  

The **Chopin Heritage in Open Access** programme, carried out between 2017 and 2020 by The Fryderyk Chopin Institute and financed by the Digital Poland Operational Programme, is the largest project in The Institute’s history aiming at digitising and sharing the collection of the Fryderyk Chopin Museum and the NIFC libraries of books, photographs and albums. As part of the programme, as many as 39,500 items were made available online – for free, for everybody and with the permission for further use. All early editions of the works of Fryderyk Chopin have also been made available in the form of digital scores (in xml, pdf and humdrum formats). All resources, including the museum and library collections, [are available on the website](https://chopin.musicsources.pl/en/){:blank}.  

The achievements of the **Chopin Heritage in Open Access** programme open up access for academics, students and musicologists to materials that are unique on a global scale, making unprecedented opportunities for research development. Working with source materials can now be faster and more accurate than ever. Anyone who would like to delve into the details of scores, compare editions of Chopin’s works or examine priceless manuscripts, can do so completely free of charge and from home!  

Digitisation is also great news for all history and art enthusiasts, who gain access to unique and new materials through the collections made available.  

The priceless treasures of the Chopin heritage can now be discovered by anyone, from anywhere in the world!
