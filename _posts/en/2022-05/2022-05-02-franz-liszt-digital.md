Just eleven years ago at the opening of the international conference “Der ganze Liszt – Liszt-Interpretationen,” [Prof. Dr. Detlef Altenburg lamented](https://deutsche-liszt-gesellschaft.de/archiv/aufsaetze-zu-liszt/111-der-ganze-liszt?showall=1){:blank}: “Even 125 years after his death, the works of Franz Liszt—unlike the oeuvres of Ludwig van Beethoven, Hector Berlioz, and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy—have still only received insufficient scholarly attention at the most basic level."

[The long-term project **Franz Liszt digital**](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/newsroom/franz-liszt-digital){:blank}, which started at the beginning of April, will hopefully change that. The goal of the project is to "compile a digital catalogue of all sources and works by composer Franz Liszt (1811 to 1886) and make them freely available online. [...] The digital Liszt portal will be jointly developed at three project locations − Heidelberg, Dresden and Weimar. Under the leadership of Prof. Wiesenfeldt, the main research location is Heidelberg University’s Department of Musicology. [...] At SLUB Dresden, a team led by Prof. Dr Barbara Wiermann will develop the information technology, and a qualification position in the field of Digital Musicology is also planned. The Goethe and Schiller Archive will work directly on the sources of the Liszt estate, under the guidance of its director, Prof. Dr Marcel Leppert."

Until the first fruits are available, you can browse [over 350 compositions by Franz Liszt in our catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Liszt,%20Franz){:blank}, including 50 autograph manuscripts.
