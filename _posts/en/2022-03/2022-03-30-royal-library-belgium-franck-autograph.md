_We have received the following from Marie Cornaz (RISM Belgium):_

Last December, the Royal Library of Belgium (KBR) acquired the complete autograph manuscript of the orchestrated version of the _Messe_ for three voices in A major by the Liège composer César Franck (1822-1890), a work listed under the reference CCF 203. This exceptional 107-page volume is the only autograph source for this orchestrated version dating from 1860 and comprising the six parts of the Mass (_Kyrie_, _Gloria_, _Credo_, _Sanctus_, _O Salutaris_ and _Agnus Dei_). Indeed, the only sources known to date for this work were, on the one hand, its published reduction for 3 voices, organ, harp, cello and double bass (the autograph manuscript of which is preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France) and on the other, the edition of the orchestral score published posthumously in 1909.

This manuscript is also remarkable because it offers the unpublished orchestrated version of the _O Salutaris_, for which the famous _Panis angelicus_ was substituted during Franck's lifetime. This major score joins the body of Franck's musical autographs already preserved in the Royal Library's collections, including melodies and cantatas, the oratorio _Ruth_, the _Trio concertant_, the string quartet, _Prelude, Aria et Final_, and the _Pièces pour harmonium_. The Royal Library of Belgium is therefore even more important as a place of conservation and promotion for the study of the work of Franck, a major 19th-century composer whose bicentenary is being celebrated in 2022.
