[In 2018](https://rism.info/events/2018/03/08/international-womens-day-women-pianists-in-rism.html){:blank} we published a post about women pianists in RISM to celebrate [International Women's Day](https://internationalwomensday.com/){:blank}. Since then, the number of women pianists in RISM has grown from 250 to over 400. All the more reason to give you an update.

Since RISM is a database that documents specific sources rather than being a general reference guide for all music or people, we only include information on people who have some sort of relationship with a source. This is a lot less often the case for pianists than for singers (for example) because singers are often directly named on the source: we have around 900 sopranos in RISM but in contrast there are only around 400 women pianists.
 
Historically, as long as women were denied access to orchestras, the piano – and harp, too – became the instrument of choice that enabled participation in any form of musical life. The fact that the piano did not serve as entertainment for only well-bred ladies of privilege is thanks to role models such as [Clara Schumann](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=clara+schumann&Language=en){:blank}, [Leopoldine Blahetka](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Leopoldine+Blahetka&Language=en){:blank}, and [Maria Theresia von Paradis](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Maria+Theresia+von+Paradis&Language=en){:blank}, who became pioneers despite facing at times considerable resistance.

Here they are, the 400 female pianists in RISM (as of March 2022):
