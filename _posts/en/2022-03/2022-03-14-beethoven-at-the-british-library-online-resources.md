_The following originally appeared on the [British Library's Music blog](https://blogs.bl.uk/music/2021/12/beethoven-at-the-british-library-a-list-of-online-resources.html) (© British Library Board, [Creative Commons Attribution Licence](https://blogs.bl.uk/music/about-this-blog.html). The British Library is currently hosting [an exhibition about Beethoven](https://www.bl.uk/events/beethoven?_ga=2.42944877.938033194.1644224074-310397521.1598974978), which can be viewed until the end of April._

Our [Beethoven exhibition](https://www.bl.uk/events/beethoven) draws on the British Library's rich collection of Beethoven material to reflect on the composer's creativity, his struggles, and the impact and legacy that he has left to future generations. This is a rare opportunity for visitors to see a wide range of Beethoven material together and up close.

To mark the occasion, this blog post draws together all the digitised Beethoven sources that are freely available via the British Library website.

# Autograph scores and sketches

Central to the exhibition, and the British Library's Beethoven collections, are the autograph scores and sketches for works from across the composer's life. These include collections of miscellaneous loose pages, later bound together, as in the 'Kafka' sketch miscellany (named after a previous owner, Johann Nepomuk Kafka, 1819-1886) which includes a draft for an early symphonic movement in C minor.

_Draft for an early symphony in C minor. British Library Add MS 29801, f. 70v._

There are also examples of the bound sketchbooks that Beethoven used from 1798 onwards, mostly dedicated to specific works, such as the one for *The Ruins of Athens*, found at the front of the 'Kafka' miscellany (ff. 1-37). A particularly magnificent example is the sketchbook for the 'Pastoral' symphony, which also includes ideas for the op. 70 piano trios, among other things. Also featured are finished scores of complete pieces, such as the op. 30 no. 3 violin sonata and various songs.
