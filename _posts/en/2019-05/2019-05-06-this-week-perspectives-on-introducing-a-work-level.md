We are counting down to our conference and workshops in just a few days: **Works, Work Titles, Work Authorities: Perspectives on Introducing a Work Level in RISM** at the [Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur](http://www.adwmainz.de/anfahrt.html){:target="_blank"} in Mainz.

For three days, 9–11 May 2019, we are going to swap ideas, have discussions, and take a look at how RISM can successfully implement authority records for works and how it will advance our project.

We are happy that many speakers from near and far will be presenting. We are looking forward to the various points of view of all participants.

Presentations will be recorded and made available on [RISM's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWLRkiqVuq8BrYbCArubi_w){:target="_blank"} after the conference. The complete program and abstracts can be found [on the conference website](/publications/introducing-a-work-level-in-rism-2019.html).
