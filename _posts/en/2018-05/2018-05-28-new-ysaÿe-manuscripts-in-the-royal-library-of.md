_We have received the following from Kris De Baerdemacker of [RISM Belgium](/workgroups/belgium-rism-belgium.html) and the [Koninklijke Bibliotheek van België, Muziekafdeling - Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, Section de la Musique](http://www.kbr.be){:target="_blank"}:_

The Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium has recently acquired three Eugène Ysaÿe manuscripts: the autograph score _Poème élégiaque_ arranged for two pianos, the complete score _Étude-Poème_ op. 9 and the autograph score of _Petite fantaisie romantique_. These manuscripts shed some new light on the existing sources of the fonds Eugène Ysaÿe. Until now, only the violin part of the _Etude Poème_ was known and the only source of the _Petite fantaisie romantique_ was a photocopy.

The manuscripts will be digitized as part of the Eugène Ysaÿe digitization project to make available all printed and manuscript music by [Eugène Ysaÿe](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Eugene+Ysaye&Language=en){:target="_blank"}. As many as 80 scores can already be accessed in the [online catalogue](http://opac.kbr.be/?lang=EN){:target="_blank"} of the Royal Library of Belgium and more sources will be added.

In the catalog, type **eugène ysaÿe** as search term in **All fields** and select **Only digitized collections**. In the **Document type** filter, you can select **Printed and handwritten scores**. Clicking on the **eye** icon will take you directly to the digitized document.
