On 14 June the [European Football Championship 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2024){:blank} started in Germany. 24 national teams had qualified for it; in the meantime two thirds of them have been eliminated. Now we look forward to the quarter- and semifinals, culminating in the final on Sunday, 14 July 2024.

In the two-day break between the round of 16 fixtures and the quarterfinals, it is worth taking a look at the musical sources for each of the 24 countries that have participated. European nations are as a rule well represented in the RISM database. That said, there are some countries where we only know of some institutions that hold resources related to the study of music: Georgia, Serbia, and Turkey. Unfortunately, at the moment we have neither sources nor institutions for Albania. If any of our readers have tips for these countries, we would be happy to hear them.

When searching for musical sources in a given country, you can use the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:blank}, select Advanced search, and change the “All fields” option to “Library siglum.” If you then enter the country code followed by a hyphen and an asterisk (which functions as a wild card here), you can find all the sources in RISM from that particular country. For example, a search for D-* will get you all the sources in host country Germany. The country codes used by RISM follow the [international vehicle registration codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_vehicle_registration_code){:blank}.

Alternatively, in [RISM Online](https://rism.online/){:blank}, you can simply type E-* to find all musical sources from Spain (at the moment one of the most probable winners of UEFA Euro 2024). Furthermore, in RISM Online one can also click on the globe icon in the top left corner to limit one’s searches to a “national collection” (but do not forget to reset this option to “Global collection” once you no longer need the restriction, since otherwise all your subsequent searches will only find sources from that single country).

And one final caveat: in RISM the institutions in England or Scotland have no special identifier, for they appear under the larger label of the United Kingdom. Therefore, in this special case one could only be searching in a roundabout way, by looking for certain cities in England or Scotland; e.g. searches for GB-E* will find the sources located in the diverse libraries and archives of Edinburgh.

What team have you been rooting for? Hopefully they are still standing? In any case, behind each of the following links are decades of work and research from our [national groups](https://rism.info/working-groups.html){:blank} who have made RISM so international.
