RISM will be hosting a conference this week on Thursday called [Documenting Musical Sources in Latin America](/publications/conferences/latin-america-conference-2016.html). We are looking forward to welcoming thirteen of our colleagues who will report on the state of describing musical sources in seven countries in Central and South America. The conference is being presented as a peripheral event of the [Gesellschaft für Musikforschung](http://www.gfm2016.uni-mainz.de/){:target="_blank"} annual congress.

Please see the [full program](/publications/conferences/latin-america-conference-2016.html#c3288) on our conference website. Respected musicologists and librarians from throughout Latin America will report on the current state of describing sources in their countries and the state of research on cultural exchange. In addition, the organizers will discuss continued progress and arrange ways of exchanging data. We are excited about this opportunity to learn from our Latin American colleagues and to explore ways of sharing our specialized knowledge with each other.

The conference will take place on **Thursday, September 15, 2016, 10:00-17:00** at the [Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur](http://www.adwmainz.de/anfahrt.html){:target="_blank"} in Mainz. The conference is **free** and **open to the public**. Please join us!
