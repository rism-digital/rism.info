_We have received the following from Eva Neumayr ([RISM Salzburg](http://salzburg.rism.info/index.php?id=82)):_

A new thematic catalog of the musical sources in the archives of the Salzburg Cathedral (RISM siglum: [A-Sd](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=A-Sd&Language=en){:target="_blank"}) has been published:

Eva Neumayr and Lars Laubhold, eds., [_Thematischer Katalog der musikalischen Quellen des Dommusikarchivs Salzburg (A-Sd)_, _Reihe A_](http://www.hollitzer.at/wissenschaft/programm/produktdetail/produkt/dommusikarchiv-salzburg-a-sd-thematischer-katalog-der-musikalischen-quellen-reihe-a/backPID/uebersicht-2.html){:target="_blank"}. Vienna: Hollitzer Verlag, 2018.

Wolfgang Amadé Mozart's church music, as we know, was largely composed for the liturgy of the Salzburg Cathedral. The cathedral's music collection was kept together and has been preserved. As a parish and metropolitan church, the cathedral was an important place for the representation of a religious court and it was a center of church music whose influence extended beyond the city borders.

This catalog of the Salzburg Cathedral's music archives presents key sources from the period between the end of the 17th and the middle of the 19th centuries for the first time within the context in which they were created. The catalog makes an important contribution to understanding the works of important composers such as Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, Johann Ernst Eberlin, Leopold and Wolfgang Amadé Mozart, Johann Michael Haydn, and Luigi Gatti.

The editors wish to thank Stephan Hirsch from the RISM Central Office in Frankfurt am Main, who provided the basis for the printed catalog by exporting the data, and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) for financing two projects. Dr. Ulrich Leisinger (Stiftung Mozarteum Salzburg/Digitale Mozart-Edition) and Dr. Thomas Mitterecker (Archives of the Archdiocese of Salzburg) have generously supported and facilitated the work on this catalog for years. Our thanks also go to them.

This catalog is dedicated to our project leader, Univ. Doz. Dr. Ernst Hintermaier, whose comprehensive and fundamental preparatory work we were able to build upon.
