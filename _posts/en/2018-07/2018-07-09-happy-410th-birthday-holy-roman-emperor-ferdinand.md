This Friday is the 410th birthday of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor from 1637 to 1657. Like many members of royalty, [he dabbled in composition](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=135163781&Language=en){:target="_blank"}—as did his successors [Leopold I](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=118571869&Language=en){:target="_blank"} and [Joseph I](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=118558390&Language=en){:target="_blank"}.

Andrew H. Weaver published an edition of [all known motets by Ferdinand III](https://www.areditions.com/publications/collegium-musicum/motets-by-emperor-ferdinand-iii-et-al-y2-018.html){:target="_blank"} in 2012. In a recent article in _Early Music_, [Weaver writes](https://doi.org/10.1093/em/cav001){:target="_blank"}:

“Imagine my surprise, then, when recently searching for works by the emperor in the online RISM-OPAC database of music manuscripts from before 1800 (always a wise thing to do periodically, even after finishing a project), when I found a recently added entry for a Latin sacred composition attributed to Ferdinand III in a manuscript in the Berlin Sing-Akademie.”

The motet in question is a three-voice piece with basso continuo that begins “Peccavimus” and is attributed to “Ferdinando” (D-Bsa SA 4661 (7), [RISM ID no.](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=469466107&Language=en){:target="_blank"}[469466107](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=469466107&Language=en){:target="_blank"}). It is part of a large collective manuscript containing nineteen other sacred pieces. The motet was copied by Hermann Koch, a cantor in Berlin at the end of the 17th century, and whose name is found on [dozens of Sing-Akademie manuscripts in RISM](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=hermann+koch&Language=en){:target="_blank"}. On stylistic and compositional grounds, Weaver was able to authenticate this “new” motet as being by Ferdinand III. A complete transcription of the motet is given in Weaver's article.

We are delighted to hear that the RISM database helped unearth a previously unknown motet by the emperor!
