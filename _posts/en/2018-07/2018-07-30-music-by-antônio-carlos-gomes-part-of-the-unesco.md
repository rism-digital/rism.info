Recently, as part of the [European Year of Cultural Heritage](http://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/){:target="_blank"}, we wrote about [European music manuscripts](in_the_news/2018/06/25/celebrating-music-manuscripts-and-the-european.html){:target="_blank"} registered on the UNESCO Memory of the World list. One of our readers, Rosana Lanzelotte, kindly pointed out to us that [this list was expanded last year](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/antonio-carlos-gomes/){:target="_blank"} to include manuscripts by a composer about whom Giuseppe Verdi once said, "Questo giovane comincia dove finisco io" (This boy begins where I left off): Antônio Carlos Gomes (1836-1896).

After initial studies in Rio de Janeiro and the world premiere of one of his cantatas in the presence of the emperor, Carlos Gomes was awarded a scholarship which enabled him to study in Milan. It was also in Milan where Gomes celebrated his greatest success: the world premiere of his opera _Il Guarany_ at La Scala in 1870. The RISM database also has two sources from this work. A copy of the overture can be found in the Biblioteca di Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte in Rome ([RISM ID no. 854003084](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=854003084&Language=en){:target="_blank"}) and the “Ave Maria” scene from the first act is preserved as parts in the Biblioteca diocesana in Ortona ([RISM ID no. 852037195](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=852037195&Language=en){:target="_blank"}).

After 1880, Gomes lived alternately in Brazil and Italy and thus became the "composer of two worlds," as he is called in the UNESCO nomination form.
