At the [IAML Congress in Cambridge last year](/publications/iaml-congresses/2023.html){:blank}, the RISM Editorial Center announced an opportunity for our international community to update RISM's Series C, the Directory of Music Research Libraries. 

The Directory is anchored in RISM's objective to document the locations of musical sources worldwide. Series C provides descriptions of these holding institutions, whether libraries, archives, museums, churches, or private collections, as well as any institution with materials that support historical music research. Each institution in Series C has a RISM siglum, or an abbreviation, that makes it possible to concisely refer to the institution.

The information from Series C is published on the RISM website in the [Directory of RISM Library Sigla](/community/sigla.html){:blank}, in the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/){:blank}, and in [RISM Online](https://rism.online/){:blank}, and is accessed by thousands of people each year. As an example, see the description of the library of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, School of Musical Studies (GR-THaums: 
[RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=ks30006002&View=rism){:blank} \| [RISM Online](https://rism.online/institutions/30006002){:blank}).

Currently there are 9,000 RISM sigla from 88 countries, with these numbers growing every year. Information about current sigla should be updated, or new institutions can be suggested for inclusion in the Directory to make it an even more useful and exhaustive tool for the international community.  

If you would like to participate in updating Series C, or if you would like more information, please contact the RISM Editorial Center: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info){:blank}.
