The [IAML Congress in Stellenbosch, South Africa](/events/2024/06/06/rism-at-iaml-congress-stellenbosch.html){:blank}, is underway. In anticipation of the congress, we have used the [Directory of South African Music Collections](https://libguides.sun.ac.za/c.php?g=742957&p=5316110){:blank} by Santie de Jongh to update our sigla for South Africa.

As part of our work to document musical sources worldwide, RISM assigns an abbreviation, called a siglum, to institutions that hold musical sources or material related to the research of music. 

RISM previously had 7 sigla for institutions in South Africa. Thanks to Santie de Jongh's research, we now have 41 sigla from 16 cities. Each entry for a South African institution has a link back to De Jongh's directory, which has descriptions of the historic music holdings and other archival materials. 

The RISM sigla can be searched in the [Directory of RISM Library Sigla](https://rism.info/community/sigla.html){:blank}, the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:blank}, and [RISM Online](https://rism.online/search?q=ZA-*&mode=institutions&page=1&rows=20){:blank}.
