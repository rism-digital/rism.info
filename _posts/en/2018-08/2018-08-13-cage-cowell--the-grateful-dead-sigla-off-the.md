Most of our readers will be familiar with our RISM Library Sigla, which are basically abbreviations that refer to an institution in a concise way. We try to document the existence of every institution worldwide that holds materials related to music research, and these institutions are assigned a siglum from us. All institutions with sigla can be searched in our Online Directory of RISM Library Sigla: [http://www.rism.info/sigla/](/sigla.html)

By "every institution worldwide," we really mean _every_ institution. We do not require sources to be in the RISM catalog in order for a siglum to be created, and the materials do not necessarily have to be old.

This means that we have recently added a few institutions to the Directory, places that you might not necessarily associate with RISM (yet).

The new sigla mean that any researcher can use the abbreviation to refer to the institutions in a publication, and complete contact information, including a link to the institution's webpage, is available for reference in our Sigla Directory.

We hope that these new institutions can be of use for researchers.

For **John Cage** researchers, we now have a siglum for the [John Cage Trust](http://www.johncage.org/){:target="_blank"} at Bard College: **US-RHjct**

There are three new-to-us institutions related to the research of **Henry Cowell** :

- [Temple of the People](https://www.templeofthepeople.org/){:target="_blank"}: A church in Halcyon, California with the William Quan Judge Library and [materials related to Cowell](https://issuu.com/josephinechang/docs/cowell-papers-at-halcyon){:target="_blank"}: **US-HAL**
- [The New School](https://library.newschool.edu/archives/){:target="_blank"} in New York: **US-NYnscl**
- The Composers' Union Library, Moscow: **RUS-Mmdk** (for the [Music Library](http://www.house-composers.ru/){:target="_blank"} of the Moscow House of Composers) and **RUS-Mbsmk** (for the [Music Library](http://%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2.%D1%80%D1%84/library-soyuz.htm){:target="_blank"} of the Moscow Composers' Union)
