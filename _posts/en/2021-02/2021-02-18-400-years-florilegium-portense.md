Strictly speaking, the number in the title above only refers to the [second part](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=993121542&View=rism){:blank} of the collection of motets published by Erhard Bodenschatz (ca. 1576-1636). [The first part](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=993121470&View=rism){:blank} appeared in 1618 and contains 115 motets for four to eight voices. A further 150 motets by over 50 composers, from Agostino Agazzari (ca. 1580-1642) to Gregorio Zucchini (after 1540-after 1616), can be found in the second part. This repertoire is strong in Italian composers, but there are also works by Christian Erbach (ca. 1570-1635), Melchior Franck (ca. 1579-1639), and Martin Roth (ca. 1580-1610)--who alone has 15 motets. 

The editor, Erhard Bodenschatz, was a cantor in Pforta, which today is part of Naumburg an der Saale in Sachsen-Anhalt (Germany). Much of the collection was compiled by his predecessor, Sethus Calvisius (1556-1615). The edition, which was dedicated to the Leipzig mayors Friedrich Meyer and Theodor MÃ¶stel, was an integral part of music education for a long time, such as at the St. Thomas School in Leipzig. Even Johann Sebastian Bach used it during his time as _Thomaskantor_ there.
