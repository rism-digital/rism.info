_We have received the following from the [RISM Digital Center](https://rism.digital){:blank}:_

[OnStage](http://onstage.rism-ch.org){:blank} is the portal for digitised documents on musical performances in Switzerland (performance ephemera, such as concert programmes and announcements). OnStage currently presents the collections of the Conservatoire de Lausanne, the Conservatoire de Genève, the Association of the Friends of Ancient Music in Basel (FAMB) and – since the beginning of 2021 – [La Musicale de la Bibliothèque de Genève](http://www.bge-geneve.ch/musicale). In addition, last year the search and presentation software was completely redesigned, so that all the collections in the portal launched in 2015 now appear in new splendour.
 
A few weeks ago, OnStage added a new collection. It is a selection of about 2,300 documents (out of a total of 20,000) from [La Musicale de la Bibliothèque de Genève](http://www.bge-geneve.ch/musicale){:blank}. The concert programmes and announcements date from 1861 to 1945. The Geneva library has also published on its blog an [entry about the programmes displayed](https://blog.bge-geneve.ch/onstage-les-programmes-de-concert-de-la-musicale-1/){:blank}. There will be more to follow. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy browsing! By the way, we have chosen a special event for our image: a [Tchaikovsky Festival programme](http://onstage.rism-ch.org/source/bmu_vg2_1_f002329){:blank} conducted by the composer on 9 March 1889 at the Grand Théâtre.
