The RISM Editorial Center will be hosting an online, introductory two-part workshop on cataloging musical sources [using the program Muscat](/community/muscat.html). The workshop is geared towards people who are planning on collaborating with RISM, but anyone interested in Muscat or RISM's cataloging guidelines is welcome to attend. Sessions in English and German will be offered. The workshop is offered at no charge.


* Monday, February 22, 2021\
10:30-12:00 (German) and 16:00-17:30 (English) _Central European Time (CET)_\
**RISM Workshop 1: Muscat basics**\
In this workshop Muscat will be demonstrated and participants will learn how to catalog a music manuscript. 

* Wednesday, February 24, 2021\
10:30-12:00 (German) and 16:00-17:30 (English) _Central European Time (CET)_\
**RISM Workshop 2: Continuation**\
This course will continue the skills learned in Monday's session. Participants will learn how to catalog manuscript collections as well as printed music. Basic knowledge of Muscat is required, either from the Monday session or participation in a previous Muscat workshop. 


Space is limited. To register, email [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info){:blank} and indicate your preference of the English or German sessions.

Muscat is web-based (no installation required), but please note [the technical requirements](https://rism.info/community/muscat.html#technical-requirements). The workshop will be held online using Zoom.

This workshop will be given again later this year. Additional workshops can be held upon request.

Muscat is used by the RISM project to catalog music manuscripts from any time period up to the present, printed materials until ca. 1900, as well as libretti and treatises.
