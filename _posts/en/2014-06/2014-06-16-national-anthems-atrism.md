The majority of the over 700 sources are recorded anonymously. Four of them are digitally available. The series A/I _Individual prints before 1800_ shows a further 300 printed editions of national anthems.

Probalby the oldest one is the Dutch national anthem _Willem (Wilhelmus Van Nassouwe)_ and dates from the years 1568 to 1572. It has functioned as a state song since 1932 for the Netherlands.
