RISM is currently prominently featured on the website of the [Music Library Association](http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/){:target="_blank"} (United States). It appears alongside its sister projects:

- Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale (RILM)
[International Repertory of Musical Literature](http://www.rilm.org/){:target="_blank"}
- Répertoire International d’Iconographie Musicale (RIdIM)
[International Repertory of Musical Iconography](http://db.ridim.org/){:target="_blank"}
- Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale (RIPM)
[Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals](http://ripm.org/index.php){:target="_blank"}

Together, these four projects are known as the R projects of musicology. As is written on the [website of the R projects](http://www.r-musicprojects.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}, "the principal function of the Rs is to create the necessary bibliographical research tools that identify and facilitate access to this extensive body of primary sources."

All four R projects are jointly sponsored by the [International Musicological Society (IMS)](http://ims-international.ch/){:target="_blank"} and the [International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres (IAML)](http://www.iaml.info/){:target="_blank"}.
