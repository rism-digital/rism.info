This year, the [annual conference of IAML Germany will take place in Dresden](https://iaml-deutschland.info/2025-dresden){:blank}. From 16 to 19 September 2025, music librarians primarily from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland will gather at the Central Library of the Städtische Bibliotheken Dresden, in the so-called Kulturpalast.

Once again, we are looking forward to a rich and dense program with exciting sessions offered by IAML Germany’s diverse working groups and commissions. The event will start with two workshops focusing on the cataloging of music prints with RISM’s cataloging software Muscat, and on copyright problems, respectively. The plenary sessions will cover topics such as Dresden's music history, the city’s most important libraries, and the broad field of digitality.

At the aforementioned RISM workshop entitled “Cataloguing Printed Music in Muscat” and taught by Martina Falletta (RISM Editorial Center), Amrei Flechsig and Andrea Hartmann (both from the Dresden office of RISM Germany), the number of participants is limited to 20, but registrations are still being accepted until Wednesday, 10 September 2025, at [Andrea.Hartmann@slub-dresden.de](mailto:andrea.Hartmann@slub-dresden.de){:blank} or [martina.falletta@rism.info](mailto:martina.falletta@rism.info){:blank}. The workshop itself will take place on 16 September 2025 from 3:30 to 5:00 PM, and is free of charge.

The other “RISM session” at this year’s conference is the meeting of the Working Group for Music Departments at Research Libraries on 18 September 2025 (2:30-5:30 PM). Balázs Mikusi (RISM Editorial Center) will discuss RISM’s perspectives for the future, Daniel Fromme will present a “Brief Report on the Revision of RISM-relevant music prints” in his home institution, the State Library Center Rhineland-Palatinate in Speyer, while Desirée Mayer and Alexander Faschon (both SLUB Dresden) will give an introduction to “Work Authority Data and the GND-Editor in RISM.”

If you have a chance to attend, we look forward to getting in touch with you both during the official discussion sessions and the coffee breaks!
