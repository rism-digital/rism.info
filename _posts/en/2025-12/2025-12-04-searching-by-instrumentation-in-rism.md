For musicians, one of the most helpful features of the RISM database is the ability to search by instrumentation. We have put together a new page to help you navigate RISM's instrument abbreviations. We also offer detailed instructions on how to search by instrument in both the RISM Catalog and RISM Online. 

Please visit our new page [Searching by Instrumentation in RISM](/community/searching-by-instrumentation.html){blank} for more information.
