Ignaz Holzbauer (1711-1783)—one of the most important representative of the Mannheim School—is particularly remembered for his German-language opera _Günther von Schwarzburg_. Two years after the premiere in Mannheim in 1777, he composed an Italian opera, _La morte di Didone_ (1779), based on a libretto by Pietro Metastasio. A revision as _Der Tod der Dido_, with German words by Anton Klein, was undertaken just one year later.  

The singspiel _Der Tod der Dido_ was brought out of obscurity through a [modern edition from Carus Verlag](https://www.carus-verlag.com/musiknoten-und-aufnahmen/ignaz-holzbauer-der-tod-der-dido-5050500.html){:blank} (Ignaz Holzbauer, _Der Tod der Dido. Singspiel in einem Akt. Musik der Mannheimer Hofkapelle_, vol. 3, edited by Bärbel Pelker, Stuttgart 1999) and a staging in Austria at the Teatro Barocco with Bernd Roger Bienert, director (August 2022). [A recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl349jIj6Pg){:blank} from the theater offers an ideal opportunity to get to know this work.   

The only handwritten source of this singspiel (RISM ID no. 900011106; [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900011106&View=rism){:blank} \| [RISM Online](https://rism.online/sources/900011106){:blank}) is preserved in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. (US-Wc).
