Edmée Sophie Gail was born on August 28, 1775 in Paris and showed musical talent as a singer and composer from a young age. The start of the French Revolution coincided with the publication of Gail's first songs in magazines, and Gail was able to continue work as a singer and composer throughout that tumultuous period. She studied voice, theory, and composition in Paris, the latter with François-Joseph Fétis, who later dedicated a Mass to her ([RISM ID no. 700006118](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=700006118&Language=en){:target="_blank"}). She published songs throughout her life, had five operas premiered, and toured Europe as a singer and accompanist (and [a](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=450013351&Language=en){:target="_blank"} [couple](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=454000094&Language=en){:target="_blank"} [of](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=450012900&Language=en){:target="_blank"} her arrangements are in the RISM database).

Sophie Gail's compositional output is reflected in part by the [53 manuscripts](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Edm%C3%A9e+Sophie+Gail&Language=en "external-link-new-window") for her works in the RISM database. Though she published a lot of chansons in music magazines and periodicals, most of the music for her in the RISM database is in the form of manuscript copies. Her first opera, _Les deux jaloux_, which premiered on 27 March 1813 by the Opéra-Comique in Paris, was her most successful opera. There are [three sources for it in RISM](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Edm%C3%A9e+Sophie+Gail&q=jaloux&Language=en){:target="_blank"}: one full score in copy dating from around the time of her death, and two excerpts that appear in larger manuscript collections. A digitized printed full score is available from the[Archives de la Ville de Bruxelles / Archief van de Stad Brussel](https://archive.org/details/lesdeuxjalouxopr00pfull){:target="_blank"}. Gail's most popular song was "[Celui qui sut toucher mon coeur](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Edm%C3%A9e+Sophie+Gail&q=coeur&Language=en "external-link-new-window")," a _chanson d'une Tyrolienne_ that is transmitted in twelve sources in libraries in Austria, Belgium, Germany, and the United States.

Gail died in Paris on 24 July 1819 and was buried at Père-Lachaise cemetery. Her former teacher, Fétis, wrote a Miserere upon her death ([RISM ID no. 403008216](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=403008216&Language=en){:target="_blank"}).
