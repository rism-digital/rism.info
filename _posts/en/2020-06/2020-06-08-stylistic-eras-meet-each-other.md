_Pater Roman has a short report for us about how things have almost returned to normal at [Heiligenkreuz Abbey](http://www.stift-heiligenkreuz-sammlungen.at/){:target="_blank"} (Austria) after these exceptional circumstances._

Gregorian chant rings out in accordance with Cistercian and Benedictine traditions at the Romanesque and Gothic collegiate church of Heiligenkreuz Abbey ([RISM library siglum: A-HE](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=A-HE&Language=en){:target="_blank"}). For the feast of Ascension Day 2020, the evening liturgical service was enriched with Renaissance and Baroque music during vespers. The abbot and his curates entered accompanied by the [_Gaillarde de la Guerre_ by Claude Gervaise](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=990020867&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (1520-1560) and left under the sounds of the _Sinfonia Instrumentale & Gavotte_ by George Frideric Handel (1685-1759). Pater Tarcisius Sztubitz OCist played on the Kober organ from 1804. Brother Anastasius Erling OCist played bassoon and our postulant Herr Jonas Uhl was on trumpet. To the joy of many, these young brothers decided to enrich the vespers for the Pentecost feast as well. In this way, our historic church space that has survived the centuries can be filled with the sounds of great masters. We unite the different centuries in our house in praise of God.
