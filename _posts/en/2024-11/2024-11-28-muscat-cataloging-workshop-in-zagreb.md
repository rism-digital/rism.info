_The following has reached us from Lucija Konfic of RISM Croatia._

Following several lectures on RISM cataloging offered to students in Zagreb and Varaždin, a public workshop about cataloging musical sources with the Muscat application was held in Zagreb on 11 and 12 October 2024. The event took place at the Library of the Music Academy of the University of Zagreb, but attendance via Zoom was also possible. The workshop was led by Dr. Lucija Konfic, collaborator of the RISM project as member of the Croatian working group. Fellow musicologists, librarians, teachers, and students from Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, and Osijek participated, testifying for the great interest in this topic – which is especially encouraging, given that several music collections in Croatia still await sorting and cataloging.

The workshop consisted of a theoretical and a practical part. Participants were first introduced to RISM in general and the organization of the Croatian working group. Then RISM’s Muscat cataloging application was presented, in connection with the basics of cataloging musical sources. The practical part consisted of describing characteristic types of musical sources in Muscat, and each participant had the opportunity to work with unique materials from the archives of the Department for the History of Croatian Music (autographs by the composer Vittorio Radeglia ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=pe51019472&View=rism){:blank} \| [RISM Online](https://rism.online/people/51019472){:blank}), and also printed editions of his works), as well as the Library of the Music Academy (autographs by the composer Ivan Zajc ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=pe30015420&View=rism){:blank} \| [RISM Online](https://rism.online/people/30015420){:blank}).
