_We have received the following from Marie Cornaz (Bibliothèque royale de Belgique - Koninklijke Bibliotheek van België)_:

It is with sadness that we learned of the death on 12 October 2024 of our Belgian colleague and friend Bernard Huys (1934-2024), who served as [IAML Vice-President](https://www.iaml.info){:blank} from 1986 to 1989. He was also one of the driving forces behind [RISM Belgium](/working-groups/belgium/home.html){:blank}. As head of the [Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels](https://www.kbr.be/en/collections/music/){:blank}, Huys played a crucial role in Belgian musical life. He joined the Royal Library in 1960 and became the very first curator of the newly created Music Division in 1970. He developed the Music Division into a dynamic center for research and musical practice. Huys actively shared his great knowledge through numerous articles in Belgian and international periodicals and through lectures at national and international conferences. As a person, he was an amiable man who closely followed the activities of his colleagues, always ready to help them.
