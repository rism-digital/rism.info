**Did you know that music in RISM's database extends beyond the year 1800? RISM has quite a bit from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Over the next few Mondays, we'll put the spotlight on some of the newer pieces in the database.**

**The first entry comes from Cheryl Martin ([RISM Canada](/international/working-groups.html)) and talks about Gustav Mahler manuscripts in Canada.**

The [Gustav Mahler-Alfred Rosé Collection](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/music/gmar.html){:target="_blank"} was donated to The University of Western Ontario (CDN-Lu) beginning in October 1983 by Mrs. Maria C. Rosé, widow of Professor Alfred Rosé; Rosé was the nephew of Gustav Mahler. The collection contains several manuscripts written by Mahler, and also several of Mahler’s manuscripts copied by Alfred Rosé.

The manuscripts have recently been [catalogued for RISM](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=CDN-Lu&author=mahler){:target="_blank"}. They include:

-

the earliest known manuscript of Mahler's Symphony no. 1 _(see image)_; this is a copyist's manuscript which includes annotations written by Mahler

-

Mahler's Clavier-Quartett, 1. Satz; manuscript copy, in the hand of Alfred Rosé

-

the text of _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_; in Mahler's hand, written on three pages of Vienna State Opera stationery

-

_Josephinen Lieder_ for tenor and piano

-

several songs

-

a few measures of the second movement of the Fourth Symphony (1 January 1902) with a note from Mahler

-

the original first movement of _Das Klagende Lied (Waldmärchen)_; copy, in the hand of Alfred Rosé

-

choral parts and a piano-vocal score prepared by Alfred Rosé for the world premiere of _Waldmärchen_, which he conducted in 1934


Some of these items [have been digitized](https://archive.org/details/mahlerrose){:target="_blank"}, and links to the digital copies will be added to the RISM records. More information about the collection, and a link to an inventory of the entire collection, can be found [here](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/music/gmar.html){:target="_blank"}.
