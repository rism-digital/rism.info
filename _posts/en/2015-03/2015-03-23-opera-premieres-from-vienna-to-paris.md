Two rarely-heard operas are enjoying premieres now - and there are interesting sources for both in RISM.


Performances of _Gli uccellatori_ (The Birdcatchers) by Florian Leopold Gassmann (1729-1774) started yesterday at the [Theater an der Wien](http://www.theater-wien.at/index.php/de/uccellatori){:target="_blank"}. There are three sources for the overture in the RISM online catalog, two in Sweden ([Uppsala](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=190008764){:target="_blank"} and [Stockholm](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=190010758){:target="_blank"}) and one at the [Fürst Thurn und Taxis Hofbibliothek und Zentralbibliothek](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=450009515){:target="_blank"} in Regensburg, Germany. The libretto by Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793) was also set to music by [Franz Xaver Süßmayr](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=530003675){:target="_blank"} (1766-1803).


Tonight, _Le Pré aux Clercs_ by Ferdinand Hérold (1791-1833) will open at the [Opéra comique](http://www.opera-comique.com/fr/saisons/saison-2014-2015/mars-avril/pre-aux-clercs){:target="_blank"} in Paris. Among the 25 sources is [one digital copy](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=270001783){:target="_blank"}. The performance material from the Dresden Opera dates from 1836, just four years after the world premiere. That this opéra comique was popular in the mid-nineteenth century can be seen in piano pieces from the time, such as the [variations by Carl Czerny](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=454001940){:target="_blank"} (1791-1857) and the [cottillon by Johann Strauss the elder](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=550280611){:target="_blank"} (1804-1849).
