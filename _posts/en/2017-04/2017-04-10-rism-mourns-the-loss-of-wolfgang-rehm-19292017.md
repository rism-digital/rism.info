The International Inventory of Musical Sources (RISM) mourns the loss of Wolfgang Rehm, who passed away on April 6, 2017.

Wolfgang Rehm was a founding member of the Association Internationales Quellenlexikon der Musik and was its treasurer from 1967 to 1990, though correspondence with him goes back to 1960. In this time, he rendered outstanding services to RISM. First, he oversaw the publication of the first nine volumes of series A/I, _Einzeldrucke vor 1800_, as an editor at BÃ¤renreiter. He established and maintained contact to the granting agencies of the project, the Ford Foundation and the Stiftung Volkswagenwerk. Along with other members of the board, Friedrich Blume and Harald Heckmann, he succeeded in integrating the RISM Zentralredaktion, which was at the time still based in Kassel, into the grant program of the Konferenz (today Union) der deutschen Akademien der Wissenschaften. This procured decades-long financing for the Zentralredaktion, with a priority on series A/II, Music Manuscripts after 1600.

After he stepped down from his position as treasurer, he remained devoted to the Association and was named an honorary member.

RISM owes a great debt of gratitude to Wolfgang Rehm. We will always cherish his memory.
