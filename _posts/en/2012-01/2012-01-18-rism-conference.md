## **Music Documentation in Libraries, Scholarship, and Practice**

To mark the 60th anniversary of RISM, an international conference will take place from 4-6 June 2012 at the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Germany (Academy of Sciences and Humanities; Geschwister-Scholl-Stra√üe 2, 55131 Mainz).

Sources are the foundation of all historical scholarship. Musical sources are, at the same time, the foundation of historical musical performance. Information about musical sources, as RISM has been compiling and providing for 60 years, thus serves both: scholarship and musical performance.

Although the basic principles of documenting musical sources have stayed constant to a large extent, the technological means of keeping, exchanging, and linking data has changed. Efforts to build up the largest databases possible must be expanded to incorporate other preexisting databases. Furthermore, linking to resources such as authority files, Google Maps, online reference works, and digitized media is also in demand. Just the sheer number of digitized materials that are offered online has vastly increased in recent years. In many cases, this makes the use of sources considerably easier.

These developments are reason enough, ten years after the conference that marked the first 50 years of RISM, to bring together the newest approaches and look into further trends about the intersections of technology, scholarship, and practice.

In this spirit, we would like to invite everyone who contributes to the RISM projects, uses RISM publications, or supports the work of RISM in general to take part in our conference.

We would be very pleased to see you there.
