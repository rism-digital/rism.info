_We have received the following from Magda Walter-Mazur (RISM Poland). We [previously reported on this cataloguing project](https://rism.info/library_collections/2021/08/02/music-collection-diocesan-library-sandomierz-rism.html){:blank} in August 2021._  

The first part of the catalogue documenting the music collection of the Diocesan Library in Sandomierz has just been released.  

The book is the work of Magdalena Walter-Mazur, Karolina Kaźmierczak and Michał Wysocki from the Institute of Musicology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and is entitled:  
[_The Music Manuscripts at the Diocesan Library in Sandomierz. A Thematic Catalogue. Vol. I: Repertoire of Church Ensemble and Keyboard Music_](https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/The_Music_Manuscripts_at_the_Diocesan_Library_in_Sandomierz._A_Thematic_Catalogue/titel_6943.ahtml){:blank}. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2021. LXXVII + 452 p.,  ISBN 9783447117166.  

The _Catalogue_ contains 1,550 records of vocal/instrumental, chamber and keyboard pieces from the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries. The Introduction discusses the history of the Diocesan Library in Sandomierz ([RISM library siglum: PL-SA](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-SA){:blank}) and gives a general description of the collection. In addition, the state of research into the collection is outlined, as well as the contents of the collection and the cataloguing methodology.   

The publication of the second volume of the _Catalogue_ is planned for 2023. It will include vocal polyphony, religious songs, organ repertoire and also the collection of the Parish of the Holy Trinity in Raków ([PL-R](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-R){:blank}), which is currently held in the Diocesan Library in Sandomierz.
