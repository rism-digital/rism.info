_The following has reached us from Park Jeong Suk (Ewha Womans University):_

As the South Korea branch of [IAML](http://www.iaml.info/national-branches/south-korea){:target="_blank"} and [RISM](http://ewha.kor.rism.info/index.php?id=531), the EMRI ([Ewha Music Research Institute](http://my.ewha.ac.kr/musicieen/){:target="_blank"}) organized an international conference entitled “Keeping Music Alive: Women Composers in Digital Music Archives” on October 27 and 28, 2017.

The EMRI has collected and digitally archived East Asian music educational materials and musicians/composers since 2011 as a part of research projects funded by NRF (National Research Foundation) of Korea. During the last three years of the project, the data has been categorized into historical periods, genres, and composers from each country, and can be found in our new database, EMDB II (East-Asian Music Database). In the process, it was found that women’s roles as teachers and composers in the early period of modernization process were much greater in forming our current contemporary music-scape than first thought.

The conference, "Keeping Music Alive: Women Composers in Digital Music Archives" was held first, to allow various voices from different perspectives to share their experiences and be heard without resulting in a single unified voice of monologism. Second, it was to generate a continuous dialogue on women musicians today in order to form strong solidarity among women researchers in various fields and to create multiple voices/polyphony for women.

The attendees of the conference were women scholars and composers from the U.S., Germany, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. The conference consisted of four sessions, and after the first session, a concert called “Voices of Women Composers of is East Asia” with works by women composers took place.
