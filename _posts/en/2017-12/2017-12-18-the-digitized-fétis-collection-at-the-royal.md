_We have received this announcement from Kris De Baerdemacker ([RISM Belgium](/international/working-groups.html)/[Royal Library of Belgium](https://www.kbr.be/){:target="_blank"}):_

The Royal Library of Belgium (B-Br) has recently digitized over 1,000 sources from the Fétis collection (more information in [French](https://www.kbr.be/fr/fonds-francois-joseph-fetis){:target="_blank"} and [Dutch](https://www.kbr.be/nl/fonds-francois-joseph-fetis){:target="_blank"}). Old prints from his music library are now available online and include treatises on music theory, masses (Jacobus Obrecht, Alexander Agricola), motets (Giaches de Wert, Pierre de la Rue, Nicolas Gombert), madrigals (Adriaan Willaert, Philippus de Monte), operas by Monteverdi, Peri, Händel, Lully, Gluck, Grétry, catalogs of music publishers, libretti and much more. This is part of a larger project to entirely digitize the Fétis collection and new items will be added. Over [1,300 links](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=B-Br&Language=en){:target="_blank"} have been added to printed editions in RISM (A/I and B/I) so far.

The Belgian musicologist, composer, music critic and teacher François-Joseph Fétis (1784-1871) was an influential figure in 19th-century musical life in Europe. He was professor of counterpoint and fugue at the Paris Conservatory from 1821, a post he held until 1833 when he was appointed first director of the Brussels Royal Conservatory and_maître de Chapelle_to King Leopold I of Belgium.

Fétis founded the_Revue musicale_in 1827, wrote numerous articles in the_Revue musicale_ and _Revue et gazette musicale_, and was author of a wide range of publications including_Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l’harmonie_and_Biographie universelle des musiciens_. After his death, his library was bequeathed to the Belgian State in 1872 and housed in the Royal Library of Belgium.

Monteverdi was one of the composers featured during the ‘concerts historiques’: fragments from _Orfeo_ (a print is also in the Fétis collection) were performed during the first ‘concert historique’ in the Paris Conservatory on 8 April 1832.
