A workshop on cataloging musical sources took place 21–22 June 2022 at the Chopin Institute in Warsaw. Guido Kraus from the RISM Editorial Center introduced new and old Polish colleagues to the topic of music documentation using Muscat.  

Present at the workshop were Danuta Popinigis (RISM Gdańsk; RISM library siglum: PL-Osem), Aleksandra Litwinienko (Gdansk Library of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences; [PL-GD](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-GD):{blank}), Paulina Doniec (Chopin University of Music; [PL-Wumfc](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-Wumfc){:blank}), Konrad Szuba (State Archive in Warsaw), and Konrad Szymański (Ossolineum Library, Wrocław; [PL-WRzno](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-WRzno){:blank}).  

We are pleased to have these new cataloging projects, which will involve printed as well as handwritten musical sources, and would like to extend a warm welcome to our new RISM contributors.
