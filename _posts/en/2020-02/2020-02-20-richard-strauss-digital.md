At last, Richard Strauss is in the public domain. As of 1 January 2020, his works may be made available to the public without any special permission or payment.

The SLUB Digital Collections now feature selected Straussiana from the library's collections, including autograph sketches to the stage works _Intermezzo_, _Die Ägyptische Helena_, and _Die schweigsame Frau_, which all premiered in Dresden; Strauss's draft of the libretto to _Ägyptische Helena_; Alfred Roller's stage designs and costume sketches for the _Rosenkavalier_, which contributed significantly to the groundbreaking success of the Dresden premiere; and a selection of letters that Strauss sent to the music director of the Dresden Court Opera, Ernst von Schuch, and to his successor as head Kapellmeister, Hermann Kutzschbach.

By the end of 2020, all Strauss autograph manuscripts from the SLUB collections will be online, plus a selection of librettos and first editions of works by the composer.

The "Richard Strauss Collection" also includes valuable performance materials from the music library of the Saxon State Opera, including instrumental parts from the premieres of the operas _Elektra_ and _Salome_. The items were digitized as part of a statewide digitizing initiative (Landesdigitalisierungsprogramm für Wissenschaft und Kultur des Freistaates Sachsen) in cooperation with the SLUB Dresden and the Staatsoper Dresden.

Music and text documents can be easily be found through the SLUB's [Richard Strauss Digital Collection](https://digital.slub-dresden.de/kollektionen/1227/){:target="_blank"}.
