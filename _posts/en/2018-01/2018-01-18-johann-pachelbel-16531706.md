We continue our series RISM A-Z with Johann Pachelbel (1653-1706). Organists certainly do not need convincing that Johann Pachelbel wrote more than just the Canon in D! Jean M. Perreault breaks down the numbers like this in his _Thematic Catalogue of the Musical Works of Johann Pachelbel_: Of the 528 entries, 421 works are keyboard instrument pieces (more than half of which are for organ), 89 vocal pieces, 16 chamber music pieces (including the famous Canon), and 2 pedagogical works. The [486 Pachelbel sources in RISM](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=119456613&Language=en){:target="_blank"} reflect this distribution as well.

Somewhat surprising is the fact that only three printed editions appeared during Pachelbel's lifetime:

-

_Musicalische Erg√∂tzung bestehend in Sechs Verstimten Partien_ ([RISM A/I: P 34](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000990047673&Language=en){:target="_blank"})

-

_Erster Theil etlicher Chorale_ ([RISM A/I: P 35](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000990047674&Language=en){:target="_blank"})

-

_Hexachordum Apollinis_ ([RISM A/I: P 36](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000990047675&Language=e){:target="_blank"}; see image)


Yet Pachelbel is one of the seventeenth-century composers who was never completely forgotten. An example of this can be seen in [a manuscript copy](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=455034292&Language=en){:target="_blank"} of the Canon and Gigue in D, which dates from around 1840 and is today in Berlin.

Johann Pachelbel had two sons who were also composers. [Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=129273813&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (1686-1764) was an organist in Nuremberg and [Carl Theodorus Pachelbel](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=132149133&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (1690-1750) spent much of his career in the American colonies.
