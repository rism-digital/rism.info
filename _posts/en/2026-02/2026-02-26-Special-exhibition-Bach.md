In a special [exhibition](More than music - New Bach sources from Leipzig - City of Leipzig){:blank}, the Leipzig City Archive (in cooperation with the Leipzig Bach Archive and the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig) presents recently discovered and yet unknown sources in regard to Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Christoph Gottsched and Georg Philipp Telemann. The following exhibition announcement is reproduced with the kind permission of the Leipzig City Archive.

From 3 February to 23 April 2026, the Leipzig City Archive will open its doors for a fascinating special exhibition: “More than Music - New Bach Sources in the Leipzig City Archive”. [Three previously unknown manuscripts from Johann Sebastian Bach’s circle were discovered](https://www.leipzig.de/newsarchiv/news/handschriften-von-j-s-bach-j-c-gottsched-und-g-p-telemann-im-stadtarchiv-leipzig-entdeckt){:blank}, including an original letter from the composer himself as well as important documents from Johann Christoph Gottsched and Georg Philipp Telemann. The discoveries were made by project collaborator Dr. Bernd Koska as part of the “BACH Research Portal” research project of the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig, based at the Bach Archive in Leipzig.
The exhibition provides new insights into Leipzig’s musical life in the 18th century: in addition to Bach’s testimony for his bass singer Gottlob Friedrich Türsch, letters and applications are on display that shed light for the first time on the institutional support of musicians by the Leipzig City Council.

A must for lovers of Baroque music and all those who wish to take a look behind the scenes of historical source research – visitors are offered here more than music: a glimpse into the world that made Bach’s work possible in the first place.

### Opening hours

Admission is free and the exhibition can be viewed during the [opening hours of the city archive](https://stadtarchiv.leipzig.de/#c209877){:blank} .
