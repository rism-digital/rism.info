RISM has now added over 60,000 records from the Italian union catalog, ICCU. The Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico delle biblioteche italiane e per le informazioni bibliografiche (ICCU) received its current name in 1975 after the Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali was founded. ICCU replaced the Centro nazionale per il catalogo unico, which was founded in 1951 and was responsible for cataloging the cultural heritage of the country's libraries. ICCU manages the national database [SBN Musica](https://opac.sbn.it/opacsbn/opac/iccu/free.jsp){:blank}.  

In 2016, RISM and ICCU came to an agreement concerning a data import for the records in the SBN catalog describing music manuscripts, and this was also signed into a contract ([see our post from the time](/new_at_rism/2016/09/26/agreement-signed-between-iccu-iaml-italy-and-rism.html)). The contract had been preceded by years-long conversations and negotiations.  

Our close collaboration began by reconciling the personal names authority file from ICCU with that of RISM. This brought to light ca. 40,000 names to edit. The number could then be reduced to 27,000 names that were associated with music manuscripts, but it still included numerous duplicates that were merged in successive phases, either automatically or by hand. Around 12,000 names remain to be processed.  

The records for music manuscripts were first imported into a test version of Muscat, our cataloging program, in 2017, numbering over 217,000 records. The RISM database, however, already contained ca. 89,000 records from Italy that had been input over the course of several decades using catalog index cards or thanks to individual projects. For example, the working group in Rome at the Istituto di Bibliografia Musicale (IBIMUS) used RISM's cataloging program PIKaDo from an early stage and cataloged various collections and published printed library catalogs (such as Giancarlo Rostirolla, _L’Archivio musicale della Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano. Catalogo dei manoscritti e delle edizioni (secc. XVI-XX)_, Pubblicazioni degli Archivi di Stato. Strumenti 153, 2 vols., Rome, 2002). It remains a big task to identify the duplicate records in the two databases and exclude them from publication. We suspect that there are still ca. 45,000 duplicate records.  

Following an intensive technical preparatory stage, the first 1,000 records were edited by hand at the beginning of 2019 and published in the RISM Catalog of Musical Sources (see our previous posts [New Music Manuscripts from Italy (ICCU) in RISM](/new_at_rism/2019/08/08/new-music-manuscripts-from-italy-iccu-in-rism.html) and [Bari, Barletta, Crispiano, Lecco, Mantova, Noci, Novara, Sassoferrato, and Vercelli](library_collections/2019/12/05/bari-barletta-crispiano-lecco-mantova-noci-novara.html)).  

And now, in August 2021, over 60,000 records from the ICCU catalog were published in RISM. The records are from libraries for which no music manuscripts had been in RISM so far. Although some fields were standardized and adapted to RISM rules, detailed editing of such a quantity of records is not possible, and a link to the original SBN record is given in each RISM record.  

Records were published from the following institutions:
