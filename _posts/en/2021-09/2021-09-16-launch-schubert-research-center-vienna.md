_We have received the following from Andrea Lindmayr-Brandl (chairwoman, Schubert Research Center):_  

On April 1 of this year a [Schubert Research Center](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/members/commissions/kis){:blank} was founded at the Austrian Academy of Sciences (Ã–AW). The aim of the center is to uncover social networks in Viennese cultural life during the first half of the nineteenth century, to highlight connecting and dividing factors across borders and disciplines, and, more generally, to understand the world in which Schubert and his contemporaries lived and worked in a more differentiated and comprehensive way. The interdisciplinary Schubert Research Center wants to be a contact point for international academics, musicians and the interested public. It will organise annual conferences and strives to promote young scholars.  

A central concern of the Schubert Research Center is also the formation of networks and communication with colleagues worldwide. For this purpose, a newsletter is sent out at irregular intervals via email, giving information about new publications, calls for papers, events, job vacancies, scholarships, etc. Please send us relevant information. To subscribe to the newsletter please write to schubert -at- oeaw.ac.at. You can unsubscribe at any time.
