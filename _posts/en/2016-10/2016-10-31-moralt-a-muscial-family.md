**Moralt, A Muscial Family**

Even if the history of the Moralt family of musicians begins much earlier, to an extent we can identify Adam Moralt (circa 1741-1811) as the founding father of the Munich branch. First engaged as a bellows blower for the organs at the Mannheim Court, he moved to Munich in 1777 because Elector Karl Theodor (1724-1799) moved his residence there.

The website [Die MORALT, Bilder einer Künstlerfamilie](http://www.hjwr.de/moralt/moralt_de/inhalt_de.html){:target="_blank"} offers a detailed overview of the Moralt family of artists.
