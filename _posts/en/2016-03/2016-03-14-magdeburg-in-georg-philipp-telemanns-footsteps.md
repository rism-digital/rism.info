These days, illustrious performers are expected once again in Magdeburg. The 23rd [Magdeburg Telemann Festival](http://telemann.org/veranstaltungen/telemannfesttage.html){:target="_blank"} focuses this year on Telemann and the concert, spotlighting works that Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) himself once presented as a concert promoter.

Beginning last Friday and continuing until March 20, there are numerous events taking place in Telemann's home town. There is something for everybody, from a walking tour in Georg Philipp Telemann's footsteps to a performance of the opera _Damon_. In all, 500 musicians from 20 countries will make Telemann's music come to life.

And today - Telemann's birthday - is the start of a two-day [scholarly conference](https://telemann.org/veranstaltungen/tagungen.html){:target="_blank"} called "Concertare – Concerto – Concert. Das Konzert bei Telemann und seinen Zeitgenossen" (The concert/concerto of Telemann and his contemporaries) featuring scholars from Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States.

Telemann was not only an extremely productive composer. He was also a music entrepreneur: a man who founded his own publishing company, organized his concerts, and sold tickets and text pamphlets. This array is also reflected in the RISM online catalog. With [over 5,000 entries](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Telemann+georg+philipp){:target="_blank"} and just about 700 links to digitized music, Telemann is high up on the catalog's leader board.

Since Telemann composed for just about every instrument and genre, and since a large number of musical sources have luckily survived, the RISM online catalog offers a rich variety of his compositions.
