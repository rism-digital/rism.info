In June, the MassDataBase was presented at the international RISM Conference, still in the stages of preparation. It has been open to the public since the beginning of October.

The database records around 40,000 settings of the Ordinary to range from the closing years of the 14th century up to the present day. In addition to general information on the works and fundamental biographic data, it also contains information on the source material and modern editions for each individual composition. The information provided is built ona systematic compilation of the established encyclopedias and source catalogues (MGG 1 and 2, New Grove, and RISM) as well as the specialist literature.

It is based upon the decade-long work of Peter and Verena Schellert (Arlesheim, Switzerland) and was developed at the Department of Musicology of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz under the direction of Prof. Dr. Klaus Pietschmann in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Christiane Wiesenfeldt (Department of Musicology Weimar-Jena) and with the support of the Department of Music Informatics of the JGU.

It is now accessible at: [www.mdb.uni-mainz.de](http://www.mdb.uni-mainz.de/)
