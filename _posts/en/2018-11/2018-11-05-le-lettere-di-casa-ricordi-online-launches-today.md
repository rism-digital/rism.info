The [Archivio Storico Ricordi](https://www.archivioricordi.com/){:target="_blank"} preserves the historical materials of one of the most significant music publishers of all time. For over 200 years, the Ricordi publishers have influenced Italian musical life not only through their publishing activities but also as impresarios, cultural supporters, and managers.

The Archivio Storico Ricordi is now expanding its [digital collections](https://digital.archivioricordi.com/){:target="_blank"} by publishing its collection of correspondence. It will be [available online](https://letters.archivioricordi.com/){:target="_blank"} beginning today.

Around 30,000 letters addressed to Casa Ricordi by composers, writers, librettists, singers, and composers, as well as 600,000 letters from the Ricordis, document the prominent position the publishing family has enjoyed. All of the letters that the historical archive holds from the beginning of the firm's activities until 1919 will be presented here.

The Ricordi family of publishers and their activities also play a large role in the RISM catalog. [Over 500 entries](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&institution=ricordi&Language=en){:target="_blank"} reflect their publication activities as well as any resulting manuscripts that came from that.
