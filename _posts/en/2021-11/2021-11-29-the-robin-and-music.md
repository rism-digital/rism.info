The fall bird migration is just about over here in Germany and many species have found their way to their winter quarters. But the [European Robin (_Erithacus rubecula_)](https://ebird.org/species/eurrob1){:blank} stays with us throughout the year and continues to show up at backyard feeders even as the days grow colder and darker.  

The robin is the [2021 Bird of the Year](https://www.nabu.de/tiere-und-pflanzen/aktionen-und-projekte/vogel-des-jahres/wahl-2021/29656.html){:blank} here in Germany as chosen by the environmental organization NABU.  

This familiar bird has been a constant companion throughout the ages and has a close relationship to music, no doubt thanks to [its own melodic song](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/){:blank} and its close proximity to people. Searching the RISM catalog by [_robin_](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=robin){:blank}, [_Rotkehlchen_](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Rotkehlchen){:blank}, or [_rouge-gorge_](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=rouge-gorge){:blank} shows how the bird has captured the imagination.

RISM only has one piece with a French rouge-gorge, a [partsong by Swiss composer Joseph Bovet](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=403003750&View=rism){:blank}. Several lieder treating the German Rotkehlchen are also present. One is by Anna Kock, in a possible autograph manuscript preserved in Kiel ([RISM ID no. 457001145](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=457001145&View=rism){:blank}). Unfortunately we don't have very much biographical information about her, only that [she was active around 1890-1910](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do;jsessionid=FFC353A90ABECCF9BBC4D4988376E996.touch02?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22pe30115493%22){:blank}. Does anyone else know more about her?  

The Rotkehlchen also charmed non-German composers. Four manuscripts of the lied ["Das Rotkehlchen" by Antonio Rosetti](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Rotkehlchen+rosetti){:blank} are preserved. And we find a Rotkehlchen in [Ignaz Pleyel's "Das Rotkehlchen,"](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=403009868&View=rism){:blank} part of his setting of 12 German Lieder in _Winter-Unterhaltung_.

In English, the bird has such an affinity to people that it is used as a first name, not least in reference to [Robin Hood](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=robin+hood){:blank}. Robin also figures as a character in countless English songs.
