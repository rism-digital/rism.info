On behalf of the Swedish IAML Branch it is a pleasure for me to invite you all to:   
**Swedish musical life during the last four hundred years: acknowledging the anniversaries of Uppsala University Library, The Royal Swedish Academy of Music and the Music and Theatre Library of Sweden**   

The meeting will take place on Zoom, 6 December at 17.00-18.30 CET (16.00-17.30 UTC) and will be followed by the traditional social hour. Since we have a Swedish theme and Christmas is approaching we have chosen to call it “adventsfika”. I will inform you about what it means and send you recipes of lussekatter (saffron buns) and pepparkakor (ginger bread) in time, so you can properly prepare for the meeting!
Anders Cato, IAML’s Secretary General, will announce the access information on [IAML-L](https://www.iaml.info/iaml-mailing-list){:blank} closer to the meeting, which will be free of charge.
