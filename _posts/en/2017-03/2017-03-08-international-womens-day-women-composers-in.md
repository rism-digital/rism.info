Today, March 8, is celebrated around the world as [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About){:target="_blank"}. Among many other things the organizers support "a call to action for accelerating gender parity."

In music, as we know, women musicians have struggled throughout history to be as visible as their male counterparts. In the RISM database, among the thousands of people that function as composers, copyists, performers, previous owners, etc. in the sources, there are 43,000 men but only 6,000 women. There are no doubt more women who were involved in the creation of a source, but their contributions are as yet undiscovered or unacknowledged. Women are also certainly hidden among the [200,000 anonymous sources](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=anonymus){:target="_blank"} in RISM. Just a few months ago, one of these was identified: an anonymous source was [discovered to be by Princess Maria Carolina of Savoy](/rediscovered/2017/01/30/a-new-woman-composer-is-born.html){:target="_blank"}, rescuing her from the clutches of anonymity and adding one more woman composer to the database.

Databases typically do not offer users the possibility to search by gender, making it difficult to find information specifically relating to women. The RISM database does not currently offer this, either—though we hope enable it in the next version of the catalog—but gender is encoded in our authority files (visible when you click on a name while looking at a record). These authority files can be searched by us in our internal database, so to celebrate the achievements of women composers, here we offer you a list of the ca. 800 women composers that you can find in the RISM catalog:

**Happy New Year!**

We start the year by looking ahead and getting ready to celebrate people in the RISM database who will have a major birthday this year or to remember those who died. We would like to begin 2017 with an overview of these people: they are not only composers but also include librettists, musicians, dedicatees, or people who are in other ways related to a source. They were born or died in a year ending in 17 or 67.

A special highlight of 2017 will be a packed calendar of events that mark the death of [Georg Philipp Telemann](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=11862119X&Language=en){:target="_blank"} 250 years ago. The celebrations, an overview of which can be viewed on the [Telemann 2017](http://www.telemann2017.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} website, will reach previously unseen dimensions of scope and diversity of activities.

To start off the celebrations, here is a sampling of ten people (of the almost 900) you can add to your calendar:
