The results list shows almost 400 entries. Among these are Vincenzo Bellini's well-known setting "I Capuleti e i Montecchi," Georg Benda's opera "Romeo und Julie," and Charles Gounod's "Roméo et Juliette."Girolamo Crescentini's insert aria "Ombra adorata apetta" in Nicola Antonio Zingarelli's opera "Giulietta e Romeo" also enjoys special popularity. But have you also heard of the operas by Johann Gottlieb Schwanenberg and Daniel Gottlieb Steibelt? Take a look at the catalog and find inspiration.
