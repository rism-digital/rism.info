Yesterday, February 1, the [Oper Frankfurt](http://www.oper-frankfurt.com/en/page820.cfm?stueck=438){:target="_blank"} celebrated the premiere of Antonio Cesti's opera _Orontea_.

Almost all of the over 100 records in the RISM database by [Antonio Cesti](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Cesti+Antonio){:target="_blank"} are for cantatas or individual opera arias with continuo accompaniment—including four arias from _Orontea_. Of the eleven operas by Cesti known today, eight were written in Innsbruck or for the Innsbruck court, which had a close connection to Italy, not least through the marriage of Ferdinand Karl of Tirol to Anna de' Medici. The big success of Cesti's operas – _Orontea_ alone was performed for over 30 years – is also reflected in its reception by contemporary composers and musicians: in Kroměříž there is [ballet music](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=550264543&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"} by Johann Heinrich Schmelzer to the opera _Il pomo d'oro_.

Below, Joyce DiDonato sings the aria “Intorno all'idol mio,” which is in the RISM database three times (RISM ID nos. [853000144](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=853000144&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}, [452008401](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=452008401&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}, and [850009718](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=850009718&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}). This third record is for the manuscript seen in the video, located in I-Nc 6.4.6 (Naples, Conservatorio di Musica S. Pietro a Majella). The digitized manuscript (also the source of the image above) is [available online](http://www.internetculturale.it/opencms/opencms/it/viewItemMag.jsp?case=&id=oai%3Awww.internetculturale.sbn.it%2FTeca%3A20%3ANT0000%3AIT%5C%5CICCU%5C%5CMSM%5C%5C0081159){:target="_blank"}.
