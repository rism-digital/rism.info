We (relatively) recently received two journal issues from the organizations that co-sponsor RISM, [IAML](http://www.iaml.info/){:target="_blank"} and [IMS](http://ims-international.ch/){:target="_blank"}. Both contain articles that discuss musical sources or institutions and could be of interest to the RISM community. They have been cataloged in Kallisto and can be cited by our RISM contributors.
