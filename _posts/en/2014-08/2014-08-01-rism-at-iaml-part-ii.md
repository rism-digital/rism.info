As we wrote in this space on Wednesday, RISM reported on its activities at the [IAML conference in Antwerp](http://www.libraryconservatoryantwerp.be/iaml2014/index.php){:target="_blank"}. Klaus Keil and Jennifer Ward from the RISM Zentralredaktion were present to share news from the Central Office.

Highlights include:

- There is a new [Board of Directors](/organization/the-association.html) and a new [Coordinating Committee](/organization.html#coordinating-committee)

- A new version of the [OPAC](http://opac.rism.info/){:target="_blank"} was released in April 2014

- RISM's data are offered as [open data](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=8&L=1&id=8){:target="_blank"}, freely available for reuse

- A new cataloging program, Muscat, is being developed to replace Kallisto

- A/1 (printed works issued separately) and B/1 (printed collections, covering the years 1500-1550) are already in Muscat and are expected to be in the online catalog in 2015

- RISM has partnered with other institutions in France, Croatia, and Italy to import data from local databases.


On the social media front, RISM continues to be active on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RISM.info){:target="_blank"} and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RISM_music){:target="_blank"}. In addition to keeping up with our users and partner institutions, we have found new ways to engage with people and be a part of online conversations about music.
