Even though the year is drawing to a close, there is still enough time to take a look at the Instrument of the Year. Last year, the state music councils in Germany [selected the oboe](http://www.rism.info/home/newsdetails/?tx_ttnews%5Byear%5D=2017&tx_ttnews%5Bmonth%5D=10&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=64&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1435&cHash=a982f2d3d6c9de4bffdb14b30d136d5b){:target="_blank"} to be the Instrument of the Year. This year, [it is the cello](https://www.instrument-des-jahres.de/){:target="_blank"}.

At RISM, [a search using "vlc"](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=vlc&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (the RISM abbreviation for cello) leads to over 102,000 results. We would like to highlight some solo concertos and quartets from this wealth of sources.

The [autograph manuscript](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=211010028&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} of a Rondo for cello and orchestra by cellist Friedrich August Kummer (1797-1879) is now in Dresden (D-Dl Mus.4869-O-13).

The cellist Domenico Lanzetti, who lived at the end of the 18th century, is somewhat unknown today. [Five of his cello concertos and two cello sonatas](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22pe30074717%22&Language=en){:target="_blank"} are in RISM so far, all of which are located in Berlin today.

The sketches for string quartets by Beethoven, such as the first movement of his [Quartet in E-flat, op. 127](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900003594&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (in US-NYj), are a special challenge (but that’s why they are so fascinating).

It is much easier to read the autograph manuscript of Emilie Mayer's [Quartet in A](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=464000310&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (D-B Mus.ms.autogr. Mayer, E. 19 M).

Searching for cello players in the RISM database shows how the cello was a "man’s instrument" until into the 20th century; of the more than 500 cellists in RISM, only 7 are women. Under the pretext that holding the instrument (between the legs!) was unladylike, women were barred from playing it for a long time. An exception is the [French cellist Lisa Cristiani](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=550503869&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (1827-1853). In RISM, she appears as the dedicatee of Mendelssohn's _Lied ohne Worte_, op. 109 (CZ-Pu 59 C 311).
