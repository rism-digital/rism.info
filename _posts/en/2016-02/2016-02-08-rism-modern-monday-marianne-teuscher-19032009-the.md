No, you're not mistaken: the dates of birth and death for Marianne Teuscher are correct. She lived to the ripe old age of 106 and is quite likely the longest-lived person in the RISM database - and as the fifth and last person in our RISM Modern Monday series, she brings us right to our present time.

It was only later in life that Teuscher was able to fulfill her original career goal of becoming a librarian. From 1966 to 1981, she dedicated herself to caring for the music collection at the Saxon State Library (Sächsische Landesbibliothek, today the SLUB) in Dresden. Prior to that, she was a music teacher and orchestral musician. For her 70th birthday in 1973, the music department at her library presented her with a congratulatory cantata by Wolfram Steude (1931-2006). Teuscher therefore appears as a dedicatee in the RISM database ([RISM ID no. 290002098](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=290002098){:target="_blank"}).

We hope that with our RISM Modern Monday series we've been able to show you that there is a lot more to the RISM database than just music before 1800. Have a look around - you may be surprised what you find!
