This weekend was supposed to see the opening of the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth. Instead, [a full, alternative program](https://www.bayreuther-festspiele.de/en/festspiele/news/2020/virtual-festival-season-and-the-cultural-summer-live-on-site/){:target="_blank"} is planned.

We'll take this opportunity to take a look at the music preserved for Richard Wagner's _Rienzi_, which was used in Dresden over a long period of time. The music material is held in two groups in the music archive of the Saxon State Opera (D-Ds): [instrumental/vocal parts](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=270000984&View=rism){:target="_blank"} and the [stage music](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=270002738&View=rism){:target="_blank"}.

Among the material for the stage music you can find [instructions for the bells](https://sachsen.digital/werkansicht/dlf/361863/529/){:target="_blank"}, from a performance in 1923.

The parts contain numerous performance markings, including from the premiere on 20 October 1842, such as the [2nd oboe's part](https://sachsen.digital/werkansicht/dlf/361862/189/){:target="_blank"} for the end of the first act. We know that the material was used up through the late 20th century thanks to a note in the [2nd trumpet part](https://sachsen.digital/werkansicht/dlf/361865/339/){:target="_blank"} at the end of the overture: “Schallplatte am 20.12.1984” (Recording on 20 December 1984).

Of course, parts that were used over the course of such a long period of time reveal much about the performance practice of the 19th and 20th centuries in the form of numerous handwritten entries, cuts, pasteovers, performance notes, and even [a taped-in newspaper article](https://sachsen.digital/werkansicht/dlf/361862/314/){:target="_blank"}. The detailed descriptions in the RISM catalog adds information about the singers and conductors when they are mentioned in the music.
