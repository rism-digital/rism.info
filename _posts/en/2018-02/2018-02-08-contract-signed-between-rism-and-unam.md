The[Seminario de Música en la nueva España y el México independiente](http://musicat.unam.mx/){:target="_blank"} at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) has been building a database called Musicat for a number of years. Its contents include the music collections of the Mexico City Cathedral. A catalog of the polyphonic books from the collection, _Los Libros de polifonía de la Catedral de México_ by Javier Marín López ([Jaén: Universidad de Jaén](http://www3.ujaen.es/servpub/b_datos/unlibro.asp?ISBN=978-84-8439-632-1){:target="_blank"}; Madrid: Sociedad Española de Musicología, 2012), offers an overview of the valuable collections held by the cathedral archive. The materials date back to the sixteenth century.

It is therefore a particular stroke of luck that RISM was able to sign a contract with UNAM, in which an agreement was made to transfer data from the Musicat catalog built by the Seminario de Música to RISM.

The contract was signed on 21 November 2017 in Mexico City by the director of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas at UNAM, Dr. Renato González Mello, joining the signature of the RISM president. This took place during a small ceremony that was part of a conference celebrating the [15th anniversary of the Seminario and Musicat](http://musicat.unam.mx/index.php/eventos/){:target="_blank"}. Prof. Dr. Klaus Pietschmann, treasurer of RISM and the current project leader, was present alongside the director of the Seminario, Dr. Lucero Enríquez Rubio, and her team, including Mario Haza. Klaus Keil and Jennifer Ward from the Central Office in Frankfurt were able to join in through Skype.

We are looking forward a fruitful partnership with Musicat and UNAM.
