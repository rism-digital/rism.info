National RISM working groups as well as individuals and institutions that contribute to RISM projects can engage with the work of the RISM Zentralredaktion and strategic decisions of the board in a variety of ways. In order to formalize this participation, an Advisory Council is formed. Five representatives are elected from the Advisory Council to form the Coordinating Committee for a term of five years. They can act as the voice of the national groups to represent their interests in front of the board and the Zentralredaktion.

The members of the Committee are involved with national working groups or work at institutions that cooperate with RISM.

The following people were recently elected to the Coordinating Committee:

-

Daniel Boomhower (Library of Congress, US)

-

Armin Brinzing (Mozarteum, Austria)

-

Marie Cornaz (Royal Library of Belgium)

-

Ewa Hauptman-Fischer (University of Warsaw Library, Poland)

-

Gottfried Heinz-Kronberger (RISM Germany)


Currently, the RISM Zentralredaktion and RISM Switzerland are developing a new cataloging program to replace Kallisto. It is especially important that the needs of the RISM national groups are taken into account throughout this process as much as possible. The Coordinating Committee will monitor and follow the development of the new program as it progresses.

The Committee represents and is for all members of RISM national groups as well as all others that contribute to RISM and is happy to receive any of their comments or suggestions.

The members of the previous Coordinating Committee were Sarah Adams (Harvard University and RISM US), Armin Brinzing (then RISM Germany), Richard Chesser (British Library), Laurent Pugin (RISM Switzerland), and Eleonor Selfridge-Field (Stanford University, US). We would like to thank them for their work.
