From the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/){:target="_blank"} in New York:

"Dongsok Shin performs the Sonata in d minor, K.9 by Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757) on the earliest known surviving piano, made by the instrument's inventor, Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731), in Florence, 1720. Scarlatti's keyboard compositions were performed on both the harpsichord and the early piano."
