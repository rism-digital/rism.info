**Happy New Year!**

As in past years, we would like to take a look at musical anniversaries for the next twelve months. It goes without saying that [Beethoven](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Beethoven,%20Ludwig%20van){:target="_blank"} will play a large role at RISM in 2020 but there are also over other 1,300 people to discover: composers, librettists, performers, dedicatees, or people who are in other ways connected to a musical source who were born or died in a year ending in 20 or 70.

Below is the list sorted alphabetically. Please note that it is divided into two worksheets, one for year of birth and one for year of death. Direct links to the [RISM catalog](https://opac.rism.info/){:target="_blank"} are included for each person. See the full list as a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qA387xfjPIN6idKQtWDA0b78MkmfWoOMeEXo2VKh5lM/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} in order to sort by name, life dates, and gender.
