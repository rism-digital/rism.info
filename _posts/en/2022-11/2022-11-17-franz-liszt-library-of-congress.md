From the earliest days of the Music Division, 1st editions and primary source materials were collected and placed in M3.3 .L76 and .L77 (1st editions), ML95 .L68 (correspondence), and ML96 .L58 (autographs and holographs). Several archival collections that also hold primary source material related to Franz Liszt or which may contain general material about Western music in the nineteenth century include: John Davis Batchelder Collection; Damrosch-Tee Van Collection; Heineman Foundation Collection, Franz Liszt Collection (American Liszt Society Collection); Mannes-Damrosch Collection; Hans Moldenhauer Archives; Harry Rosenthal Collection; Gisella Selden-Goth Collection; Harold Spivacke Fund Collection; Gertrude Clarke Whittall Foundation Collection.
