This year's Academy Day of the [Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities](https://www.akademienunion.de/){:blank} took place in Leipzig on 6 October 2022. The theme of the day was Music and Society. Different research projects from the eight member academies were presented alongside a packed accompanying program. The close proximity of the Gewandhaus, Paulinum, and Oper Leipzig allowed the participants and guests to move easily between the venues and take advantage of the diverse aspects of the program.  

Presentations, discussions, and short musical performances were held in connection with different sessions entitled Music and Ancient Cultures, Music and the Economy, Music and Education, Music and Impact Research, Music and the Media, and Music and Health. The music was played from editions that were prepared by the academies.  

In the Paulinum, there was a poster session that featured the musicological projects that are part of the Academies Programme. The RISM Editorial Center and RISM Germany each had a poster. Undine Wagner, Nicole Schwindt, and Martina Falletta were available in the coffee breaks to chat with interested members of the public.  

The festive evening event was dedicated to the questions “Global music? Universal music?" The podium discussion was accompanied by Sephardic and South American music from Ensemble Combo CAM (Care About Music). The actress Doris Meeresbüchner interspersed the discussion with stories about her life and experiences, accompanied by tea and homemade treats.
