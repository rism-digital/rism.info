On Monday, 10 October 2022, representatives of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw (Narodowy Instytut Fryderyka Chopina, NIFC) visited the RISM Editorial Center in Frankfurt following the conference [Musical Sources: Past and Future](/publications/conferences/musical-sources-past-future-2022.html) for RISM's 70th anniversary in Mainz. The meeting was held to discuss future joint projects and the continuation of projects currently underway.  

At the conference, our colleague Marcin Konik from NIFC emphasized in his presentation how easy and fruitful it is to work with NIFC's online catalog and RISM's source catalog, as well as involving other institutions such as Polish libraries and archives and the RISM Digital Center in Switzerland. Despite all the technical requirements for this networking, the basis of the joint projects does not change: examining musical sources, digitizing them, and cataloging them in RISM's cataloging program, Muscat.  

The project Chopin Heritage in Open Access, which [we reported on in May](/electronic_resources/2022/05/12/chopin-heritage-in-open-access.html), has already been completed and is available to the public.  

The project Heritage of Polish Music in Open Access, which [we reported on in February 2019](/library_collections/2019/02/18/close-cooperation-between-rism-and-the-chopin.html), is almost complete as planned. [An overall project description is available here](https://nauka.nifc.pl/en/dziedzictwo-muzyki-polskiej-w-otwartym-dostepie){:blank}. In the future, the project will expand to include material related to Polish music heritage both inside and outside of Poland. The Editorial Center will certainly provide strong assistance in this undertaking. A [link to the Polish Music Heritage database can be found here](https://polish.musicsources.pl/en){:blank}.  

We would like to thank the director of the NIFC, Dr. Artur Szklener, as well as our colleagues Marcelina Chojecka, project leader Dr. Marcin Konik, and Jacek Iwaszko for visiting us in Frankfurt.
