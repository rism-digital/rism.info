RISM's series B covers specific categories of repertory. The newest volume has just been published: RISM B/XVIII/1.  

Christian Meyer: [_Les sources manuscrites des séquences et proses notées. IXe-XVIe siècles, vol. 1 France, Catalogue descriptif_](https://www.henle.de/de/detail/?Titel=_2532){:blank},
Munich: G. Henle Verlag, 2022, 751 p., ISBN 978-3-87328-159-2, ISMN 979-0-2018-2532-8  

This volume treats manuscript sources for sequences and notated proses that are found in French libraries. The vast repertory of melodies and liturgical poetry ranges from the end of the 9th century to the beginning of the modern era. The manuscript tradition of the handwritten sequences and proses takes many forms, including individual leaves inserted into manuscripts and comprehensive collections. The catalog is organized alphabetically by city. The material descriptions focus on the sequences and proses but codicological analysis was largely omitted. As an aid, the end of the book includes an alphabetic index of prose and sequence titles as well as an index of the incipits, which is meant to identify the melodies.  

The volume fills a gap in the cataloging of medieval monophonic music.
