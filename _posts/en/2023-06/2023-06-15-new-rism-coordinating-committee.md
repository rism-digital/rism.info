RISM relies on its international partners and benefits from several structures in place to maintain a close relationship between RISM, its sponsoring societies, and its working groups. One of these bodies is the [Advisory Council](/organization.html), whose membership includes all active RISM contributors around the world. Five members from Advisory Council form the Coordinating Committee, which is charged with facilitating communication between the working groups and the Editorial Center, conveying suggestions and requests between both sides, and encouraging conversation among the working groups.  

We would like to welcome the five new members of the Coordinating Committee:  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
- JeongYoun Chang (Ewha Womans University, South Korea; re-elected)  
- Christina Linklater (Harvard University, USA)  
- Eliška Šedivá (National Library of the Czech Republic)  
- Sonia Rzepka (University of Warsaw, Poland)  
- Steffen Voss (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Germany)  

The new members will be confirmed at the next meeting of the Advisory Council, which will take place at the [IAML Congress in Cambridge this July/August](/publications/iaml-congresses/2023.html).  

We would like thank the previous members of the Coordinating Committee for their work: Stefan Ikarus Kaiser, Zuzana Petrášková, Roland Schmidt-Hensel and Sonia Wronkowska. We are looking forward to working with the new committee.
