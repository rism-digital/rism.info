We recently told you about the Badische Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe and [how they completed cataloging for their historical music](/library_collections/2022/05/30/historical-music-from-the-badische-landesbibliothek.html).  

Among their collections is the archive of the composer, pianist, and poet Clara Faisst (1872-1948). Her 150th birthday is on 22 June. After studying at the Königliche Hochschule in Berlin, Faisst was active in her hometown of Karlsruhe as a music teacher and pianist. Most of her compositions were self published. That her archive has been preserved at all is due to the fortunate fact that it was rescued from the trash at the beginning of the 1990s. The [31 pieces by Clara Faisst in RISM](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=pe30074802){:blank} are almost all lieder.  

You can [listen to some works by Clara Faisst](https://zkm.de/en/clara-mathilde-faisst){:blank} on the website of the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. As part of the digital festival [Feminale der Musik – Female Composers](https://zkm.de/de/veranstaltung/2020/04/feminale-der-musik-female-composers){:blank} in 2020, one or two women composers were featured each day of the event.
