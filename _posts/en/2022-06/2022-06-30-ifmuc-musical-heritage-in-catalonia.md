_We have received the following from Josep Maria Gregori i Cifré (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona):_  

Catalonia is one of the few European regions on its way to discovering the richness of its musical heritage with respect to the repertory of compositions by its chapel masters, organists and musicians, which are conserved but often neglected in numerous, mainly ecclesiastic, archives.  

The IFMuC project, a Catalan acronym that stands for 'Inventories of the Music Fonds of Catalonia', launched in 2001-2002 at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona with the participation of the Institut d’Estudis Catalans. Since then, IFMuC has registered numerous archives, fonds and collections of manuscripts on the ‘Census Fontes Musicæ Cataloniæ’, and has catalogued 28 different fonds housed in public, ecclesiastic and private archives. That is a total index of more than one thousand composers and 15,247 works, mostly Catalan.  

IFMuC is building a digital platform in order to facilitate free access to all our records of the manuscript collections made up of authored works, anonymous works, choir books, polyphonic books, and printed scores.
