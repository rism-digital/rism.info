[This year's annual IAML Congress](https://www.iaml.info/congresses/2023-iaml-congress-cambridge-united-kingdom){:blank} will take place in Cambridge, England and will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the IAML UK and Ireland branch.  

Please look at the [IAML Cambridge page on our website](/publications/iaml-congresses/2023.html) for the RISM events during the week: a RISM session, meetings of the Advisory Council and the Commission Mixte, and a two-part Muscat cataloging workshop.  

On Tuesday, 1 August, we will hold an introductory workshop to Muscat, the cataloging application used by RISM. The workshop is geared toward any potential RISM contributors as well as anyone interested in gaining insight into RISMâ€™s cataloging methods. After attending both the morning (11:00-12:30) and the afternoon (14:00-15:30) sessions of the workshop, participants will be ready to start their own RISM projects and contribute directly to our database.  

There is no charge for Congress attendees but space is limited. Please register by sending an e-mail to [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info). **Participants must bring their own laptops.**  

We are looking forward to seeing you all in Cambridge!
