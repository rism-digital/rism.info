**The Symphony and Ireland:
A Symposium**

**20 April 2013**

**Dublin Institute of Technology
Conservatory of Music & Drama, Rathmines**

_In association with the Society for Musicology in Ireland & the National Library of Ireland_

_An International Association for Music Libraries, Archives & Documentation Centres (UK & Irl) Jubilee Celebration Event_

__

_The Symphony and Ireland_ symposium aims to examine the context and trajectory of the symphony in, and of, Ireland. It will bring together leading international academics and contemporary Irish symphonic composers to facilitate a contextual discourse on the composition and consumption of the genre in Ireland.

The catalyst for this symposium was the recent discovery of the parts for the first-known symphony composed in Ireland, uncovered in the National Library of Ireland by RISM Ireland/DIT researchers. The symphony was composed in Dublin by the French composer Paul Alday _c_1816 and was one of two he wrote during this period. Prior to this discovery, the library of the Royal Irish Academy of Music held only incomplete parts, but the newly uncovered parts provide a complete set for performance. These parts have been digitally transcribed by students of the DIT Conservatory of Music & Drama in preparation for the first performance of this symphony since the early nineteenth century.

This event is free of charge but registration is required. Please email [catherine.ferris@dit.ie](mailto:catherine.ferris@dit.ie) by Friday 12 April to confirm attendance.
