Along with [C. P. E. Bach](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=carl+philipp+emanuel+bach){:target="_blank"} and [Christoph Willibald Gluck](/events/2014/07/07/does-christoph-willibald-gluck-deserve-better.html){:target="_blank"}, there is another composer who was born exactly 300 years ago: Niccolò Jommelli (1714 – 1774). Jommelli was famous in his lifetime for his numerous operas and also wrote a number of oratorios, masses, and other sacred vocal music. While he was the _Ober-Kapellmeister_ in Stuttgart (1754-1768), he attracted top-notch performers and built one of the best orchestras in Europe.

In the RISM database of printed music (A/I: _Individual Prints Before 1800_) there are 41 records, mainly prints from London and Paris.

In the online database, there are [more than 2,600 sources](https://opac.rism.info/search?author=niccolo+jommelli){:target="_blank"}. You will see there are seven digitized manuscripts, all from German libraries.

One of them is "[E quando sarà mai](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=210045549){:target="_blank"}," a solo cantata for soprano and accompaniment. It is from the Royal Private Music Collection in Dresden, which Nina Eichholz reported on [in this space](http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/article/2/on-the-trail-of-music-at-the-dresden-court.html){:target="_blank"} earlier this month.

Here is a recording of "Al mio vorace affanno" from this cantata. [The Dresden copy](http://digital.slub-dresden.de/id403040191){:target="_blank"} was written for performance, and you can see from the digital version how easy it is to read the notes on this centuries-old manuscript. _Please begin on p. 3 using the table of contents on the left_.
