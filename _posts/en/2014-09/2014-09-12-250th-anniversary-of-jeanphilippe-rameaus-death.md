Jean-Philippe Rameau died 250 years ago today. The RISM online catalog has [230 works by him](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Jean+Philippe+Rameau){:target="_blank"} in over 40 libraries. The sources are widely disseminated throughout Europe and the United States and are mostly of Rameau's stage works. There is also one [autograph manuscript](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=402005262&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"} among them: sketches to a keyboard suite in A minor that are held today by the University Library in Basel, Switzerland.

Many commemorations took place in the days after Rameau's death in 1764, not only in Paris, where he had lived, but also throughout France: Avignon, Dijon, Marseille, Orléans, and Rouen.

The music that was played during Rameau's funeral service at St. Eustache is also indexed in RISM. The requiem by Jean Gilles (1668-1705) is [here](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=452020015&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}and more information can be found in [Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_%28Gilles%29){:target="_blank"}. The chorus "Que tout gémisse" from Rameau's tragédie en music _Castor et Pollux_ is in the [RISM online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=452000625&db=251&View=rism){:target="_blank"}. An interesting short film about Rameau's funeral with excerpts from the requiem and interviews about the other works played is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zzbaABSpGQ){:target="_blank"}and an article is on the [Rameau 2014](http://rameau2014.fr/A-la-une "external-link-new-window") website.

The most recent publication about Ramau is: Graham Stadler, _The Rameau Compendium_. New York: Boydell & Brewer, 2014 (ISBN: 9781843839057).
