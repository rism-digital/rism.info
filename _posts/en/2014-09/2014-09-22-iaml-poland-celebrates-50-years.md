This week, our Polish colleagues are celebrating the 50th anniversary of [IAML Poland](http://www.iaml.pl/){:target="_blank"} with a conference in Warsaw on 23-24 September 2014. The topic of the conference is Music Information in the Future (Muzyczna Informacja Jutra). IAML president Barbara Dobbs Mackenzie has been invited to deliver a presentation about the IAML organization and the [R projects](http://www.r-musicprojects.org/){:target="_blank"}, including RISM. Sonia Wronkowska from the Polish RISM Centre at the Polish National Library will present the digital project [Polona](http://polona.pl/){:target="_blank"}, which includes musical sources. Dr. Artur Szklener from the Chopin Institute in Warsaw will talk about the future of online Polish music portals. We hope our colleagues have a successful and fruitful conference and of course a lot of good fun during the celebrations.

To the next 50 years!

Guido Kraus and the RISM director Klaus Keil have posted their congratulations on the [IAML website](http://www.iaml.info/en/node/1168/){:target="_blank"}.
