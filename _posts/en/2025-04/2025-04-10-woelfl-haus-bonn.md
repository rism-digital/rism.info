A catalog of Joseph Woelfl’s works, listing no fewer than 620 compositions, was first published in 2011 (RISM short title: HaiW - [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/rism/Search/Results?type=AllFields&lookfor=lit30026255){:blank} \| [RISM Online](https://rism.online/search?q=HaiW&mode=sources&page=1&rows=20){:blank}). Its second edition will be made available online at the end of 2025, as well as in print the following year. 

In 2022, Susanna Kilian and Margit Haider-Dechant were trained at the RISM Editorial Center in Frankfurt am Main, and has since been entering all extant and available Woelfl compositions into the RISM database ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/rism/Search/Results?type=AllFields&lookfor=pe146298){:blank} \| [RISM Online](https://rism.online/people/146298){:blank}). Each new record is also double checked by the staff of the Editorial Center. Thanks to the excellent cooperation, this major project should be completed by the end of June 2025.

From 2 to 4 May 2025, the [Seventh International Joseph Woelfl Symposium](https://www.woelflhaus.de/events/vii-internationales-jospeh-woelfl-symposium-2025){:blank} will take place at the Woelfl House in Bonn, with speakers and performers from 12 countries. The 2nd volume of the complete edition of Woelfl’s works and the 2022/2024 volume of the Joseph-Woelfl-Almanach will be presented during the opening reception hosted by the City of Bonn in the Gobelin Room of Bonn’s Old Town Hall. The almanac will contain a concordance list of the opuses and works without opus numbers that have been changed for the second edition of the Woelfl catalog. By the time of the symposium, all articles that have appeared in the Joseph-Woelfl-Almanach since 2012, will also be available in a database of the Woelfl-Haus Bonn.
