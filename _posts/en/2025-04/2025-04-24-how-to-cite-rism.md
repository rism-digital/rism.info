Many publications, whether online or in print, use their own style guides. However, citation styles frequently do not capture the nuances of historic music manuscripts and printed editions, making it difficult to identify the item with absolute clarity. RISM has recommendations for researchers and librarians when citing musical sources, including those found in the RISM database. Following our guidelines will help reduce ambiguity in your citations. Clearly identifying the item will also help RISM find it quicker in our database, enabling us to cite your research in our records or respond to user queries. 

Visit our new page, [How to Cite RISM](/community/how-to-cite-rism.html){:blank}, to find RISM's recommendations for citing music manuscripts and printed editions in publications.
