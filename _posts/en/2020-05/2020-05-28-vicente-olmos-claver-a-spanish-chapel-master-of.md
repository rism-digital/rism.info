_We have received the following from Ángel Marzal, who recently cataloged the works of [Vicente Olmos Claver](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Vicente+Olmos+Claver){:target="_blank"} for RISM._

Vicente Olmos Claver was born around 1744 in Catarroja, a Spanish town located near Valencia. According to documentation in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Valencia, our chapel master began singing as an _infantillo_ in the Cathedral's choir of the chapel of music in 1754 [footnote 1]. Later, he was named _mosso de capella_ on June 22, 1762, as stated in one of the notarial protocols of the archive of the Cathedral of Valencia [footnote 2].

Shortly after, in 1763, the master Olmos Claver wrote two polyphonic psalms that started his extensive liturgical production: the psalm _Dixit Dominus 1.r tono_ ([RISM ID no. 1001111437](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001111437&View=rism){:target="_blank"}) [footnote 3] for 8 voices with organ accompaniment and _otro_, as well as the psalm _Beatus Vir 2º tono_ ([RISM ID no. 1001111521](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001111521&View=rism){:target="_blank"}) [footnote 4], also for 8 voices with organ accompaniment and continuo. Both manuscripts are signed _Maestro Olmos_ and are kept in the musical archive of the _Santa Iglesia Catedral of Segorbe_. With these early musical compositions Vicente Olmos Claver began a production that he would not interrupt until he died. Soon after, he was appointed _Acòlit_, acquiring the responsibilities of that post in the music chapel of the Valencia Cathedral. The archive of the Cathedral preserves several recently published documents that prove this [footnote 5].

In 1768, Vicente Olmos Claver was also appointed _maestro_ of one of the main music chapels in the city of Valencia: the music chapel of the _Palacio Real_ of Valencia. Therefore, Vicente Olmos combined his activities both in the _Palacio Real_ of Valencia and his duties in the Cathedral. In fact, the "Cabildo" of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Valencia granted Olmos permission to take on his duties in the _Real_ [footnote 6].

Four years later, in 1772, Vicente Olmos Claver won the post of chapel master of the _Santa Iglesia Catedral_ of Segorbe at an examination board. This new condition put an end to the bond that he had maintained for almost two decades with the Metropolitan Cathedral of Valencia, where he had trained with the chapel masters José Pradas, Pascual Fuentes and Francisco Morera. Likewise, it seems that his new post in the Cathedral of Segorbe, a town far from the city of Valencia, necessarily meant that he had to abandon the post of chapel master in the _Palacio Real_ of Valencia. Although Vicente Olmos Claver spent a mere eight years in Segorbe, this was his most prolific period in terms of musical creation; his musical catalogue grew enormously, [especially in the composition of liturgical _villancicos_](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Vicente+Olmos+Claver&q=villancicos){:target="_blank"}.

The last biographical period of Vicente Olmos Claver takes place in the Hieronymite monastery of _Nuestra Señora de la Murta_ in Alzira where he became a monk in 1780. Thus, the documentation of the _Murta_ certifies the first reception of Vicente Olmos Claver in the monastery in an act signed on October 27, 1779 [footnote 7]. This document states that our author arrived at the monastery as a priest. The Acts of March 2, 1780 [footnote 8], July 25, 1780 [footnote 9], and September 8, 1780 [footnote 10] effectively record the acceptance of Vicente Olmos Claver into the community of the Hieronymites of _Nuestra Señora de la Murta_ in Alzira [footnote 11].

The _Carta de Profesión_ of Vicente Olmos Claver dates from November 1, 1780. This document is found in the _Libro de profesiones del monasterio de Nuestra Señora de la Murta_ which is kept in the library of the _Ateneo Mercantil_ of Valencia [footnote 12]. This manuscript went unnoticed for over 230 years until it was published in our research (MARZAL 2013 and 2019). We must point out that it was at this time, a time of extraordinary spirituality, that Vicente Olmos Claver changed his name to the monastic _Fray Vicente de Nuestra Señora de los Desamparados Olmos_. Our author spent more than 30 years in the monastery of the _Murta_ in Alzira. Ultimately, he died in 1812 in his native town of Catarroja, according to the _Libro de Misas_ of the monastery [footnote 13]. If Vicente Olmos Claver was born around 1744 and died in 1812, he must have died at the age of approximately 68.

As for the musical production of Vicente Olmos Claver, it can be framed generically as sacred music: first, because there is not a single secular piece in his catalogue of works and second, perhaps, especially because it is a corpus of music that was written in and for the Church. Nevertheless, and always within the aforementioned generic framework, it is essential to emphasize that the work of Vicente Olmos Claver can be classified into two clearly differentiated typologies.

On the one hand, the musical pieces composed for the strictest celebrations of Christian worship, always with a Latin text, are classified as liturgical music.

On the other hand, we find a different stylistic group made of musical compositions intended for more minor church functions. Here we find different genres and forms of the musical liturgy differentiated not only by their text in the vernacular, but perhaps even more so by the degree of freedom in the more technical aspects of musical composition. This group has been classified as paraliturgical music.

Our study of Vicente Olmos Claver has allowed us to corroborate that his music is currently kept duly catalogued in two Valencian archives: the archive of the _Catedral Metropolitana_ of Valencia ([RISM library siglum: E-VAc](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=E-VAc&author=Vicente+Olmos+Claver){:target="_blank"}) and the archive of the _Santa Iglesia Catedral_ of Segorbe ([RISM library siglum: E-SEG](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=E-SEG&author=Vicente+Olmos+Claver){:target="_blank"}; CLIMENT 1979 and 1984). The Valencia Cathedral archive holds five compositions: a Psalm and four Lamentations in five shelfmarks on which we have worked extensively in our studies mentioned above (MARZAL 2013 and 2019). The archive of Segorbe Cathedral holds 48 compositions by Vicente Olmos which we have also dealt with extensively in the same previous works.

Indeed, the archive of Segorbe preserves twelve liturgical compositions; six Psalms, one Verse, two Lamentations, one Mass, one "Magnificat" and the _Completas_. Moreover, it holds all the output of paraliturgical music by our author, specifically 36 liturgical _villancicos_, a “Quatro”, the "Misterios" and an Aria _â Duo_ composed especially for the feast of the _Santísima Trinidad_. There is no doubt that in Vicente Olmos's paraliturgical production, liturgical _villancicos_ predominate, which we will often find grouped in series of four compositions for each shelfmark. All in all, we can say that, at present, we have in these archives 53 musical compositions by our author.

To conclude, we must point out that it has not been our purpose in this brief review to go into stylistic matters in depth, but rather to outline the creative career of a Valencian chapel master whose contribution to Spanish music will undoubtedly be valued by future generations. All the research on Vicente Olmos Claver is included both in our PhD thesis (MARZAL 2013) and in the recent publication _La música de Vicent Olmos i Claver_ (MARZAL 2019). In both works we will find numerous unpublished documentary sources about the author.
