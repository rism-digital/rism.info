This week we will highlight the works of Pedro António Avondano (1714-1782), a Portuguese composer who was born 300 years ago this April.

Although he was born and died in Lisbon, his works have seen more of the world than he did. The [RISM database indexes 62 sources](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Pedro+Ant%C3%B3nio+Avondano){:target="_blank"} for Avondano, mostly instrumental chamber music, but also his dramma giocoso _Il mondo della luna_ (1765). The minuets, knows as the Lisbon minuets, would have been performed at balls for the entertainment of the foreign community in Lisbon. They must have made a good impression on their listeners. The ex-pat British community in Lisbon saw to it that three collections of his minuets were published in London between ca. 1766-1770 (RISM A/I A 2947, A 2950, and A 2948, today held by the British Library).

Today, Avondano's manuscripts are held in places as far apart as Paris, New York, and Tokyo. Using a Google Fusion Map, it is easy to see how far his music has travelled from Portugal. _Note: Google Fusion Tables were discontinued in 2019._

A conference called ["Niccolò Jommelli, Christoph Willibald Gluck and Pedro António Avondano, in the occasion of their 300th anniversary: The circulation of musical repertoires in 18th-century Europe"](https://goldenpages.jpehs.co.uk/2014/02/27/niccolo-jommelli-christoph-willibald-gluck-and-pedro-antonio-avondano-in-the-occasion-of-their-300th-anniversary-the-circulation-of-musical-repertoires-in-18th-century-europe/){:target="_blank"} will take place in June 2014 in Lisbon, Portugal. The call for papers has been extended to April 5.
