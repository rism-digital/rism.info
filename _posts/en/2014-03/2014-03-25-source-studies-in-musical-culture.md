We would like to announce the recent publication of papers presented at a conference organized by the Department of Musicology of Adam Mickiewicz University and the Archdiocesan Archive in Poznań, Poland in September 2011:

Alina Mądry and Magdalena Walter-Mazur, eds. _Source Studies in Musical Culture_. Interdisciplinary Studies in Musicology 11. Poznań: [Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu im. Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu](http://www.muzykologia.amu.edu.pl/68_interdisciplinary-studies-in-musicology.html){:target="_blank"}, 2012. 304 p. ISBN 978-83-7654-248-5.

The eighteen articles, all in English, offer a representative overview of the research landscape of historic musicology in Poland. The authors of the articles present the results of their intensive source research. Many articles are dedicated to manuscripts and printed editions that were previously unknown to scholars, such as those from Otýn (Wartenberg; now in PL-Pmim) or concerning [Esaias Reusner, Jr](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=Esaias+Reusner){:target="_blank"}. Other notable articles include the report by Irena Bieńkowska on musical life in Slutsk between 1733-1760, Ewa Hauptman-Fischer on the music collection belonging to the Dominican [Pius Hancke](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Pius+Hancke){:target="_blank"}, Maciej Jochymczyk on the widely disseminated manuscripts of [Amandus Ivanschiz](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Amandus+Ivanschiz){:target="_blank"}, and Danuta Popinigis on the long tradition of carillon music in Gdańsk (Danzig).

The editors of the book are the musicologists Alina Mądry and Magdalena Walter-Mazur of Poznań. Most of the contributors are affiliated with RISM or use RISM's resources intensively for research. Guido Kraus of the RISM Zentralredaktion participated in the conference and reported on RISM, its history, and its publications.

For the convenience of RISM contributors, the volume itself as well as the individual articles are indexed in Kallisto so that they can be cited in the RISM entries. The table of contents may be viewed on the publisher's website: [http://www.muzykologia.amu.edu.pl/uploads/publication/sp-tr-int-11-pdf.pdf](http://www.muzykologia.amu.edu.pl/uploads/publication/sp-tr-int-11-pdf.pdf){:target="_blank"}
