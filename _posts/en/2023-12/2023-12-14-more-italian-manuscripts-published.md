As early as September 2021 we published source descriptions RISM had taken over from the Italian union catalog maintained by ICCU. For details, see our report [“ICCU and RISM: An Immense Number of Records”](https://rism.info/new_at_rism/2021/09/06/iccu_and_rism_an_immense_number_of_records.html){:blank}.

This time we are happy to report on the publication of more than 16,000 records representing music manuscripts from the following institutions:\

Thanks to earlier cataloging projects, the RISM database had already included some source descriptions from these institutions. With that in mind, we first had to check carefully whether some of the imported entries might be duplicating already existing ones. Given the vast amount, in-depth adjustment of the descriptions themselves to RISM’s standards was out of the question. As with other similar publication projects, however, the links to the original records in the Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale (SBN) have been included.

With these new records added, users of the RISM Catalog and RISM Online can now search among more than 1.5 million source descriptions.
