Sometimes musical sources are well hidden. Or would your normally expect an imprint entitled _Discourse Introductory to a Course of Lectures on the Science of Nature_ to have an appendix containing [three vocal pieces](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=00000990026614&Language=en){:target="_blank"}?

The _Discourse_ is actually interesting in several regards. The author of the book itself is Charles W. Peale (1741-1827), who was known as a landscape and portrait painter. Peale was also interested in the natural sciences and his _Discourse_ can also be understood as a plea for the establishment of museums. The year in which this item was printed, 1800, tells us that we are still quite a ways from a Darwinian understanding of nature, and consequently Peale's idea of a museum cannot be compared to modern ones: animal preparations are part of the collections alongside paintings and other works of art.

This world view, in which a theological view of nature and the natural sciences is closely interwoven with the fortune of humankind, is also evident in the three songs:

- “[The beauties of creation](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001034800&Language=en){:target="_blank"}” with the opening text “Mark the beauties of creation, mark the harmony that reigns”

- The dirge “[What alas was Aldrovandus' fate](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001034802&Language=en){:target="_blank"},” a reference to the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605)

-

“[Ode on the death of Titian Peale](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001034803&Language=en){:target="_blank"},” with the opening text “His early loss let science mourn,” a reference to Peale's son who died in 1798 at the age of 18


The words to these songs are by Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), another son of the book's author. The music is by John Isaac Hawkins (1772-1854), and English engineer and inventor who made a name for himself as a piano builder.
