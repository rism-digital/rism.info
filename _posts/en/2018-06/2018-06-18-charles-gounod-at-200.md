Yesterday we celebrated the 200th birthday of the French composer, conductor, and organist Charles Gounod (17 June 1818 – 18 October 1893).

Gounod is especially known today as the composer of the operas _Faust_ (1859) and _Roméo et Juliette_ (1867). But this does not do justice to his extensive oeuvre, which took all genres into account.

Sacred music forms the center of Gounod's compositional output. In 1839, he won the Prix de Rome at the Paris Conservatory. While in Italy, he was deeply impressed by the vocal polyphony of the 16th century, especially by the works of Palestrina, which he heard in the Sistine Chapel. Fanny Hensel, who was also in Rome at the same time, shared German music and literaturewith him, including the writings of Goethe. Gounod studied theology upon his return to Paris. Though he was never ordained, he liked to sign his letters “l'abbé Gounod.” His deep religious beliefs were expressed in many sacred works.

He finally became world famous in 1859 with his opera _Faust_, which in Germany became known by the name of the actual hero of the work, Margarethe. Gounod was a _maître de chapelle_ and organist, and from 1852 to 1860 he was the director of the Orphéon de la Ville de Paris, the largest men's chorus in the city. Due to the Franco-Prussian war, Gounod went to London in 1870, where he remained until 1874. After his return, he devoted himself to composing sacred music.

Gounod's [_Méditation sur le 1er prélude de Bach_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=455032074&Language=en){:target="_blank"} is also very famous, a melody that Gounod wrote in 1852 for violin and piano, superimposed over Johann Sebastian Bach's Prelude no. 1 in C from the _Well-Tempered Clavier_. In 1859, he added the _Ave Maria_ text to it.

Charles Gounod composed 12 operas, incidental music, oratorios, cantatas, around 15 masses (including requiems), orchestral music, chamber music, and numerous other choral works, songs, piano pieces, and instrumental pieces.
