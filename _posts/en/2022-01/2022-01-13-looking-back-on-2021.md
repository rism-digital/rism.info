As with [presenting the year's musician anniversaries](/musical_anniversaries/2022/01/10/musician-anniversaries-2022.html), it has become custom for us to take a look back on the past year and share what was most popular with our website readers. These are the year's blog posts that were read the most often, according to our website statistics:
