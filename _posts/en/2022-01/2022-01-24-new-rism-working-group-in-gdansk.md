_The following is by Danuta Popinigis and Agnieszka Kubiak (RISM Gdańsk):_    

The first RISM Gdańsk working group started in 1997 at the Stanisław Moniuszko Academy of Music in Gdańsk, Poland. The team consisted of four people: Danuta Popinigis (head), Danuta Szlagowski (†), Jolanta Woźniak and Barbara Długońska. Approximately 8,500 records were entered into the RISM database. They document the musical manuscripts from the Gdańsk Library of the Polish Academy of Sciences ([RISM library siglum: PL-GD](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-GD){:blank}), the State Archives in Gdańsk ([PL-GDap](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=PL-GDap){:blank}) and from the collection known as the  "Danziger Bestand," which is located in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin ([D-B, Ms. Danzig](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=D-B&q=ms+Danzig){:blank}).  

In 2021, it was decided to close the working group at the Academy of Music in Gdańsk and create a new group at the Polish Academy of Sciences' Gdańsk Library, which is the most important institution in Gdańsk, with the richest collections of music manuscripts and printed music editions.  

The new RISM group consists of 4 participants: Danuta Popinigis (head), Jolanta Woźniak, Aleksandra Litwinienko and Agnieszka Kubiak, who has just started to catalogue with Muscat.  

Thanks to cooperation between the Chopin Institute in Warsaw and the Gdańsk Library, the latter's rich collection of music will soon (March 2022) be available online. The work of digitising and cataloguing the collection of Gdańsk music is a part of the “Heritage of Polish music in open access” project, conducted by the Chopin Institute.  

A further project being undertaken by the working group in Gdańsk is cataloging the music manuscripts from library of the Warmia Metropolis' "Hosianum" Major Seminary in Olsztyn (PL-Osem). A printed catalog of the collection will be published in summer 2022. Following this publication, the records will be published in the RISM online catalog.
