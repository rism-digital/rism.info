_Our colleague Roberto Scoccimarro from the SLUB in Dresden (D-Dl) brings us the latest from the_ _[Dresden Court Music](http://hofmusik.slub-dresden.de/news/details/single/neue-zuschreibungen-bei-den-ariensammlungen/){:target="_blank"}_ _project._


Arias in the Royal Private Music Collection are full of exciting surprises, allowing us to identify composers and put stray arias back with their operas.

One example is a manuscript (D-Dl Mus.2666-K-1) that contains anonymous strophic compositions in Venetian dialect (_arie da battello_). These "gondola songs" are actually textual parodies and arrangements of arias from _L’amor di figlia_ by Giovanni Porta and _Amalasunta_ by Fortunato Chelleri, both performed in the 1720s in Venice.

Apart from this case, which is also interesting for ethnomusicologists, numerous other manuscripts can be named.

One aria, "[Va tra le selve ircane](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=212008686){:target="_blank"}," which was previously considered to be a doubtful work by Pergolesi, was securely assigned to Galuppi's opera _Artaserse_. A similar case is a manuscript with a title page erroneously assigning the contents to Niccolò Jommelli's opera _Sofonisba_. It is in fact an excerpt from the opera _[Sofonisba](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=212008266){:target="_blank"}_ by Tommaso Traetta.

Overly eager 19th-century librarians also made incorrect attributions from time to time. On the table of contents for a collection of twelve arias (D-Dl Mus.2667-I-1), all works were attributed to an unknown "Battoni." More precise research has shown that some of the excerpts are from the opera _Nicoraste_ (Venice, 1745) by the composer Giovanni Battista Patoni (or Pattoni, ca. 1713-1773) and the other arias are works by Johann Adolph Hasse.

Finally, two previously anonymous arias in particular deserve to be named: they have turned out to be compositions by Prince Anton of Saxony, son of Maria Antonia and Friedrich Christian of Saxony. These works were written in 1775 for _L’isola disabitata_ (RISM no. [212008731](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=212008731){:target="_blank"} and [212008732](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=212008732){:target="_blank"}).
