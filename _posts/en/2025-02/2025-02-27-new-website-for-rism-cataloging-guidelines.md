The RISM Editorial Center announces the publication of the RISM Cataloging Guidelines on a dedicated website developed by the [RISM Digital Center](https://rism.digital/){:blank}, [guidelines.rism.info](https://guidelines.rism.info/){:blank}. The guidelines are RISMâ€™s rules and procedures for describing historical musical sources, and are adapted for use in the [cataloging program Muscat](https://rism.info/community/muscat.html){:blank} which is used by RISM contributors worldwide.

As the the largest and only global organization that documents written musical sources, we hope that making our cataloging guidelines widely available contributes not only to transparency regarding the records found in the [RISM database](https://rism.info/publications.html#rism-database){:blank} but also acts as a resource to the wider international community of people who wish to describe historic musical sources, whether as a musician, archivist, librarian, or in any other capacity.  

We are initially making the English guidelines available and will add more languages as the translations are migrated: Catalan, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish, with Korean in preparation. We are also planning on publishing more of our controlled vocabulary, including a chart of RISM instrument abbreviations with crosswalks to other vocabularies.
