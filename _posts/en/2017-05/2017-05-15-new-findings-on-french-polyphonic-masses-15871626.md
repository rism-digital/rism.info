_The following is a guest post by Laurent Guillo:_

In November 2016, a volume gathering 26 music prints published by the Ballard workshop in Paris between 1587 and 1626 was discovered in the early books collection of the [Bibliothèque de Fels](http://www.icp.fr/){:target="_blank"} (Institut catholique de Paris; RISM siglum: F-Pic). At the beginning are 14 polyphonic masses by Orlando di Lasso, printed between 1587 and 1617, including five previously unknown editions (Missa _Ad placitum_ 4v and _Dic Domina_ 5v of 1607, Missa _Jager_ 4v and _Domine Dominus noster_ 6v of 1613, Missa _Quinti toni_ 4v of 1617). Nearly all of these 14 copies are unique in France (others are only found in London and Cologne).

In addition, there are 12 prints with music by Jehan (Jean) Titelouze, Hugues de Fontenay, Eustache Du Caurroy, Claude Le Jeune, Jean de Bournonville, and Pierre Lauverjat. Here the findings are rather extraordinary. New editions of extant masses include the first edition of Du Caurroy’s _Missa pro defunctis_ 5v (1610, known through its 1636 reprint) and Missa _Ave Maria_ 4v by Bournonville (1618, known through its Bogard reprint in 1619). Unknown works are the two (previously) lost masses of Du Caurroy (_Quam dilecta tabernacula_ 4v and _Quam bonus Israel_ 4v, in 1610), the first known mass by Fontenay (1622, a composer working in Bordeaux), a new set of _Magnificat secundum octo modos_ by Bournonville (1614), and four masses by Titelouze (_In ecclesia_ 4v, _Votiva_ 4v, _Cantate_ 6v, _Simplici corde_ 6v, all 1626). This composer is already famous for having laid the cornerstone of the French organ school, with his _Hymnes_ and _Magnificat_ of 1623 and 1626.

This volume probably reflects what was sung in French churches of this time: a mix between late Renaissance masters such as Du Caurroy and Lassus, and the first generation of French seventeenth-century masters who, as Titelouze did, have traced the road of Baroque influence. The reason why this volume had not been identified before remains a bit mysterious: it comes from the music library of the Minims of Paris, set up for the personal use of the theorist Marin Mersenne, and entered the library in 1912 ...

Bibliographical details can be found in: Laurent Guillo, “Découverte à la bibliothèque de Fels (Institut catholique de Paris)d’un recueil de messes contenant des œuvres retrouvées de Titelouze, Du Caurroy, Fontenay et Bournonville (Paris, 1587-1626),” [_Revue de musicologie_](http://www.sfmusicologie.fr/index.php?id=64){:target="_blank"} 102/2 (2016), p. 379-394.
