The RISM Central Office hosted a conference entitled "[Documenting Musical Sources in Latin America](/publications/sources-in-latin-america-2016.html)" on September 15, 2016. We invited respected musicologists and librarians from throughout Latin America to report on the current state of describing sources in their countries and the state of research on cultural exchange. These presentations were recorded and are [now available on RISM's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9SyOIE9iSYI-qGaDNQhXCptexIif8Scm){:target="_blank"}.

Our speakers shared information about cataloging projects being undertaken in seven countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. The conference was a peripheral event of the [Gesellschaft für Musikforschung annual congress](http://www.gfm2016.uni-mainz.de/){:target="_blank"} and took place at the [Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur](http://www.adwmainz.de/){:target="_blank"} in Mainz.

We would like to thank Gabriele Buschmeier and our colleagues at the Akademie in Mainz for their support of this conference and for hosting us in their facilities. We would also like to thank Steffen Schneider for editing the videos and his colleagues for their assistance with recording the presentations. The videos are also available on the website of the [Akademie's media library](http://bit.ly/1ZQ6ZKV){:target="_blank"}.
