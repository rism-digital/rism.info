_We received the following from [RISM Belgium](/workgroups/belgium-rism-belgium/home.html):_

The Music Division of the [Royal Library of Belgium](http://www.kbr.be/language_selection){:target="_blank"} acquired a new important collection in December 2016: the Fonds Toots Thielemans, named after the Belgian musician who passed away on 22 August 2016 at the age of 94.

The collection consists of hundreds of sound recordings (78 rpm, vinyl records and CDs) and thousands of documents such as photographs, press articles, scores, letters and concert programmes. The “Fonds Toots Thielemans” offers the possibility to discover and study the career of this world-famous musician who conquered the world with his harmonica and guitar on numerous recordings (records, CDs, films) and in concerts.
