**Happy New Year!**

We start the year by looking ahead and getting ready to celebrate people in the RISM database who will have a major birthday this year or to remember those who died. We would like to begin 2017 with an overview of these people: they are not only composers but also include librettists, musicians, dedicatees, or people who are in other ways related to a source. They were born or died in a year ending in 17 or 67.

A special highlight of 2017 will be a packed calendar of events that mark the death of [Georg Philipp Telemann](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=11862119X&Language=en){:target="_blank"} 250 years ago. The celebrations, an overview of which can be viewed on the [Telemann 2017](http://www.telemann2017.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} website, will reach previously unseen dimensions of scope and diversity of activities.

To start off the celebrations, here is a sampling of ten people (of the almost 900) you can add to your calendar:

- [Susanna Centlivre](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=11866896X&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (1667-1723), Irish actress and writer

Chronologically speaking, we begin with the Roman historian [Livy](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=118573624&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (born Titus Livius, 59 BC–17 AD) and end with the German writer [Kuba](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=118567349&Language=en){:target="_blank"} (born Kurt Barthel, 1914-1967).
