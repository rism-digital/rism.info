_We have received the following from our colleagues in IAML Austria:_

[IAML Austria](http://www.iaml.at/){:target="_blank"} successfully held two Muscat workshops recently.

On January 12, 2017, a Muscat workshop was held at the [Internationale Stiftung Mozarteum](http://www.mozarteum.at/){:target="_blank"}, led by Dr. Eva Neumayr (RISM Salzburg). The workshop enjoyed active participation from its seven attendees.

This week, Dr. Neumayr also presented Muscat during the Study Day of the [Verband Österreichischer Archivarinnen und Archivare](http://www.voea.at/){:target="_blank"} (Association of Austrian Archivists) held at the [Archiv der Erzdiözese Salzburg](http://www.kirchen.net/archiv/home/){:target="_blank"}.

The second workshop took place on January 18, 2017, at the [Austrian National Library](https://www.onb.ac.at/){:target="_blank"} in Vienna and was led by Dr. Ikarus Kaiser (RISM Oberösterreich). Nine participants practiced creating records in Muscat using music manuscripts from [Stift Wilhering](http://stiftwilhering.at/){:target="_blank"} and the National Library.

The next Muscat workshop in Austria is expected to take place in fall 2017.
