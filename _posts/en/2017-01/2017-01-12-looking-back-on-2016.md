The year 2016 was a big year for us: we released our long-awaited and well-received cataloging program [Muscat](/new_at_rism/2016/11/14/welcome-muscat.html){:target="_blank"}, we invited thirteen colleagues to speak on the state of source research in Central and South America at the conference [Documenting Musical Sources in Latin America](/publications/conferences/latin-america-conference-2016.html), and we published another volume in Series B ([_Die Triosonate_](/new_publications/2016/12/02/new-volume-in-series-b-published-trio-sonatas.html){:target="_blank"})_._ Not to mention all the work contributed by our colleagues around the world—we will have a separate post about that later on.

Let's take a look back at 2016. Allow us to share the top ten stories from the past year, at least from the point of view of our website statistics:

1. [First Music Manuscript Discovered in Antarctica](/rediscovered/2016/04/01/first-music-manuscript-discovered-in-antarctica.html){:target="_blank"}: Our April Fool's joke (we tricked some of you!)

**RISM in publications**
RISM was also mentioned in a number of articles in 2016, including an update of the article in _Grove Music Online_, but also articles where RISM is used as a resource in digital humanities projects. See the full list [in the RISM bibliography](/publications/bibliography.html#c2606).


We are looking forward to a productive and newsworthy 2017!
