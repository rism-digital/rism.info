We would like to announce the availability of a new webpage that provides access to the latest version of the RISM dataset. The page [RISM Data Exports](https://rism.digital/exports/index.html){:blank} is where you can find RISM's records for sources (the file name beginning with _source_) and authority records (the files beginning with _institution_, _person_, and _publication_). This dataset is used in the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu){:blank} and [RISM Online](https://rism.online/){:blank}. The exports are updated at the beginning of each month. The records are encoded in MARCXML. 

On the page [RISM Cataloging Guidelines](https://guidelines.rism.info/){:blank}, you will find descriptions of the MARC fields used by RISM and what kind of data to expect in them.

The RISM dataset is released as open data with a [Creative Commons CC-BY 3.0 license]( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/){:blank}. You are free to download and modify the data. You must give credit to RISM when republishing the data, and you must not apply any further restrictions for others' use and access of the data. 

For further data options, see also:
- The [Data page of the RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/data){:blank} for the data in RDF as well as BEACON files
- The [RISM Online Documentation](https://rism.online/docs/){:blank} for the API
