_We received [this announcement](http://gregorian-chant.ning.com/group/lesmanuscritsduweb/forum/topics/the-new-database-music-manuscripts-online){:target="_blank"} from Dominique Gatté and is posted with kind permission:_

We are excited to announce that the new database MMMOd (Medieval music manuscripts online database) is now online.

[musmed.eu](http://musmed.eu)

In June 2017, I published an initial version of this database using [Google Fusion Tables](http://gregorian-chant.ning.com/group/lesmanuscritsduweb/forum/topics/new-database-6900-music-manuscripts-online-mmmod){:target="_blank"}. The new database is the result of a collaboration between Jan Koláček (webmaster) and me.

In addition to searching by [source](http://musmed.eu/sources){:target="_blank"} and by [library](http://musmed.eu/archives){:target="_blank"}, a number of search criteria are already available such as searching by source type, century, and religious order. Some searches are still being developed, such as searching by [notation](http://musmed.eu/notation){:target="_blank"} and [repertoire](http://musmed.eu/repertoire){:target="_blank"}.

Do not hesitate to register for MMMOd to write your comments on this or that source ...
