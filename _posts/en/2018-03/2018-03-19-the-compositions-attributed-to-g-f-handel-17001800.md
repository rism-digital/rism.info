This one is new to our bookshelves:

Hans Joachim Marx and [Steffen Voss](http://de.rism.info/de/mitarbeiter/dr-steffen-voss.html#c3002){:target="_blank"}, _Die G. F. Händel zugeschriebenen Kompositionen, 1700-1800 / The Compositions Attributed to G. F. Handel, 1700-1800 (HWV Anh. B)_ ([Hildesheim: Olms, 2017](http://www.olms.de/search/Detail.aspx?pr=2008841){:target="_blank"}). ISBN: 978-3-487-15483-1.

This book is the result of a project called “Händel-Incerta,” or works of uncertain Handel authorship, which was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft from 1999 to 2003. Now we have a systematic appraisal of the compositions attributed to Handel. The book supplements the _Händel-Handbuch_ which appeared between 1978 and 1986 ([_Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der Werke Händels_, HWV](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=HWV&Language=en){:target="_blank"}) by Bernd Baselt and has the abbreviation [HWV Anh. B](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=HWV+Anh.&Language=en){:target="_blank"}.

In total, 380 compositions were identified for evaluation and each one was examined to determine whether the piece was genuine or false. The authors explain: “A composition could (ideally) be verified as genuine if connections could be found to authentic compositions by Handel, whether to earlier or later versions of individual phrases (borrowings) or, in the case of vocal works, to printed libretti. A composition could be declared inauthentic if its authorship was attributed to another composer in reliable manuscript or printed concordances. As we expected, only a small proportion of the Handel incerta could be proven 'authentic' or 'inauthentic.' (p. 17).

Some parts of the book were already published in the _Göttinger Händel-Beiträge_ (2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012): arias and songs (part I), duets, cantatas and serenatas (part II), oratorical works and church music (part III), and works for orchestra (part IV). New to this volume are sections on instrumental chamber music (part V; HWV Anh. B 401-477) and music for keyed instruments (part VI; HWV Anh. B 501-645). The catalog consists of 400 pages and includes additions to parts I through IV. Each entry consists of: title, music incipit, composer, instrumentation, sources, provenance, editions, bibliography, and notes. Various lists and indexes are included as appendixes. The preface and introduction of the book, as well as the notes to each entry, are easy to use in German and English.
