_[Note: This post was updated in 2022.](/events/2018/03/08/international-womens-day-women-pianists-in-rism.html)_  

Today is [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/){:target="_blank"}. [Last year](/events/2017/03/08/international-womens-day-women-composers-in.html){:target="_blank"} we published a list of the ca. 800 women composers who are found in the RISM online database. In June we added [eight more](/new_at_rism/2017/06/29/eight-more-women-composers.html){:target="_blank"} names to the list and in October [another twelve](/new_at_rism/2017/10/19/twelve-more-women-composers.html){:target="_blank"} were added.

This year we would like to focus on the women pianists in RISM. Since RISM is a database that documents specific sources rather than being a general reference guide for all music or people, we only include information on people who stand in some sort of relationship with a source. This is a lot less often the case for pianists than for singers (for example) because singers are often directly named on the source: we have around 650 sopranos in RISM but in contrast there are only around 250 women pianists.

Historically, as long as women were denied access to orchestras, the piano – and harp, too – became the instrument of choice that enabled participation in any form musical life. The fact that the piano did not serve as entertainment for only well-bred ladies of privilege is thanks to role models such as [Clara Schumann](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=clara+schumann&Language=en){:target="_blank"}, [Leopoldine Blahetka](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Leopoldine+Blahetka&Language=en){:target="_blank"}, and [Maria Theresia von Paradis](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Maria+Theresia+von+Paradis&Language=en){:target="_blank"}, who became pioneers despite facing at times considerable resistance.

Here they are, the 250 female pianists in RISM:
