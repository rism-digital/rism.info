The previous entry in the series RISM A-Z was on [Adolph von Henselt](/rism_a_z/2015/07/23/adolph-von-henselt-18141889.html){:target="_blank"} so today we bring you a name that sounds similar: Fanny Hensel (1805-1847).

In the RISM database there are [over 180 sources](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=fanny+hensel){:target="_blank"} for Hensel, the vast majority of them being autograph manuscripts that are held by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. Thirteeen of Hensel's manuscript albums and several individual pieces have been digitized and are freely available online.

Hensel's manuscripts at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin are part of the [Mendelssohn Archive](http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/abteilungen/musik/sammlungen/bestaende/f-mendelssohn-bartholdy/){:target="_blank"}, a comprehensive collection of materials relating to the entire Mendelssohn family. The archive preserves works from throughout Hensel's life, from 1819 to 1846, and the materials were kept in the family until ultimately given to the library in 1964.

The earliest autograph manuscript, the lied "[Ihr Töne schwingt euch fröhlich durch die Saiten](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=462104100){:target="_blank"}," dates from when Hensel was 14 years old. A late manuscript in Hensel's hand, the chorus "[Morgengruß](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=462017400){:target="_blank"}" from 1846, is decorated with a colorful bouquet of flowers (see image, above). Since the manuscript is dated July 6, the birthday of her husband, one might suspect that this work was a gift from Fanny to Wilhelm.

Below is a slightly different version of "Morgengruß," sung by the Vocal Concert Dresden:
