After sharing an [announcement last week](/events/2015/10/28/collecting--performing--exploring-dresdens.html){:target="_blank"} about a conference on court music in Dresden, we'd like to invite you on a journey south and take a look at [Südwestdeutsche Hofmusik](http://www.hof-musik.de/){:target="_blank"} - Music in Southwest German Courts. The goal of this project, which started in 2006 and is funded by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, is to "comprehensively collect and process archival and musical sources on the social and institutional history of court music" in the region.

The project's website [www.hof-musik.de](http://www.hof-musik.de/){:target="_blank"} offers an overview of [court musicians](http://www.hof-musik.de/html/a_hofmusiker.html){:target="_blank"}, the [residences](http://www.hof-musik.de/html/residenzen.html "external-link-new-window"), and [instrument building](http://www.hof-musik.de/html/instrumentenbau.html){:target="_blank"} in the eighteenth century. The musical sources are documented [in a database](http://www.haw.uni-heidelberg.de/forschung/forschungsstellen/hofmusik/hofmusik-noten.de.html "external-link-new-window").

Numerous publications have already come out on topics such as the orchestra at the Mannheim court and court opera in Schwetzingen (just west of Heidelberg) as well as dozens of music editions by composers including Christian Cannabich, Wilhelm Cramer, Ignaz Holzbauer, and Carl Stamitz. Some editions have been published by Carus but most are [available directly from the project](http://www.hof-musik.de/html/notenausgaben.html){:target="_blank"}.

In addition, results of the project are being presented in [lectures and concerts](http://www.hof-musik.de/html/archiv.html){:target="_blank"}.
