Dear working group contributors, supporters, and friends of RISM,   
  
I have been the director of the RISM Central Office for nearly 30 years and have worked here for more than 37. The time has come for me to go. On 31 August 2020, I will leave my position and go into retirement.  
  
It is a privilege to be able to work in a field that you like and that suits you, all while having a secure job—my many visits to our working groups and conferences abroad have shown me this.  
  
During these visits, I was always received very warmly. So much was shown to me that I otherwise would not have been able to see. I always appreciated the perspective of a foreign country provided through our local hosts; it goes far beyond the superficial tourist route.

I have been able to see valuable works from many music collections and now and again I was able to absorb myself with the background of a collection. I know that many people have to fight to work with musical sources, often under difficult circumstances. But the fascination of working with old, original sources is motivating and perhaps compensates for it.  
  
For all of this, and for much more, I would like to thank you all personally. It was a great pleasure to have been able to bring the RISM project forward with you. May the road to success continue with my successor, Balázs Mikusi.  
  
With best wishes,

Klaus Keil
