The ability to trace the distribution of musical sources is one of the strengths of the RISM database. Music manuscripts are by their very nature unique, while any given printed edition potentially exists in multiple copies. Finding those printed editions that have only survived in a single known copy has benefits for all kinds of RISM users. Performers can find rare materials to bring to life on the stage, music antiquarians can assess the scarcity of what they offer, musicologists can focus on rare publications, librarians can target unica in digitization projects, and RISM contributors can prioritize their institution's unique copies when cataloging their collections for RISM.

Fortunately, the question of which early printed music editions are unica can be answered with a few clicks, at least with respect to the editions that were included in [RISM Series A/I and B/I](/publications.html#series-a-inventories-of-musical-sources){:blank}, which have already been integrated in our online database. It is also possible to locate unica within a specific country or region.

Visit our new page, [Finding Unica in the RISM Database](/community/finding-unica-in-rism.html){:blank}, for details on how to search for these special kinds of sources.
