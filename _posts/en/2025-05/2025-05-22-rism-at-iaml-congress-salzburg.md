This year’s [annual congress of the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres](https://iaml2025.at/){:blank} will take place in Salzburg, Austria.

Please look at the [IAML Salzburg page on our website](/publications/iaml-congresses/2025.html){:blank} for the RISM events during the week: a RISM session, a meeting with the Coordinating Committee and the Commission Mixte, and a two-part Muscat cataloging workshop.

On Tuesday, 8 July, we will hold an introductory workshop to Muscat, the cataloging program used by RISM. The workshop is geared toward any potential RISM contributors as well as anyone interested in gaining insight into RISM’s cataloging methods. After attending both the morning (9.00-10.30) and the afternoon (14:00-15:30) sessions of the workshop, participants will be ready to start their own RISM projects and contribute directly to our database. There is no charge for Congress attendees but space is limited. Please register by sending an e-mail to [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info){:blank}. Participants must bring their own laptops.

We are looking forward to seeing you all in Salzburg!
