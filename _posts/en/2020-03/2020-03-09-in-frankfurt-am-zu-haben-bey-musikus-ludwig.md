By fortunate coincidence, a short while ago we were able to identify the previously unknown "Musikus Ludwig," who produced custom-made manuscript copies of Italian and German vocal music at the beginning of the 19th century in Frankfurt am Main. Starting with an advertisement in the _Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung_ (AmZ), we used church registers in Frankfurt and various theater almanacs to identify the person as Johann Wilhelm Ludwig (1765–1838), a contrabass player in the Frankfurt Theater Orchestra.

Ludwig placed an announcement in the AmZ in January 1805 advertising his services as a copyist (see image). Since Ludwig consistently annotated his copies with sentences such as "Se trouve a Francfort s/m chez le Musicien Ludwig," we could clearly identify Ludwig as the copyist [in over 50 records in RISM](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/perma.do;jsessionid=DD73EF53B1C23D16CD921E798BD6369E.touch01?v=rism&q=-1%3d%22pe41023353%22){:target="_blank"}.

One example of his manuscripts is [RISM ID no. 450012930](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=450012930&Language=en "external-link-new-window") ([available online](https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:31-78540){:target="_blank"}).
