As a precautionary measure due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the RISM Central Office in Frankfurt has been closed since 19 March 2020. We are currently working in a limited capacity, so we thank you in advance for your understanding.

We continue to be reachable through the usual ways, including [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/RISM-R%C3%A9pertoire-International-des-Sources-Musicales/103775449663308){:target="_blank"}, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RISM_music){:target="_blank"}. You can keep using the RISM online catalog at [opac.rism.info](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:target="_blank"} and the monthly updates will continue.

Stay healthy, everyone!
