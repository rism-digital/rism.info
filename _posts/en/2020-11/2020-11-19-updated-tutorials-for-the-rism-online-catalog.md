New, updated tutorials are now available for the [RISM Online Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4).   

All tutorials are available through the [catalog's Help page](https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/help) as well as through [RISM's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWLRkiqVuq8BrYbCArubi_w) and the playlist [Guides to the RISM Online Catalog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9SyOIE9iSYL2YlhBKnoLn9ZUuw7Rjc13).   

All videos are in English and include English captions.
