In March 2010, the Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium had the good fortune to acquire the private music collection of the Brussels jazz specialist Marc Danval (b. 1937). This collection contains more than 12,000 78 rpm, 33 rpm and 45 rpm LPs and 800 books about jazz and popular music in general and in Belgium in particular. The collection also contains more than 2,000 illustrated scores printed between the end of the 19th century and 1950, with cover pages illustrated by great Belgian artists such as René Magritte, Peter De Greef, and Jean Van Caulaert.
