_Natasha Roule, a candidate for the PhD in historical musicology at Harvard University, has spent the summer as a Pforzheimer Fellow at Houghton Library, Harvard’s principal repository for rare books and manuscripts, including rich holdings in print and manuscript music. Here is her account of her project, which saw the creation of many new records for the RISM A/II database._

The John Milton and Ruth Neils Ward Collection at [Houghton Library, Harvard University](http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton){:target="_blank"}, contains extensive holdings of 17th- and 18th-century manuscript volumes of French music. Many manuscripts represent full or short scores of Jean-Baptiste Lully’s _tragédies en musiqu_e, while others are musical miscellanies that gather popular pieces from operas and other sources into single volumes. As a [Pforzheimer Fellow](http://library.harvard.edu/06112015-1629/pforzheimer-fellowship-program-confirmed-2015){:target="_blank"} at Houghton Library, I have spent this summer cataloguing eleven volumes from the Ward Collection into RISM ([900020000](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020000){:target="_blank"}, [900020274](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020274){:target="_blank"}, [900020408](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020408){:target="_blank"}, [900020710](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020710){:target="_blank"}, [900020370](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020370){:target="_blank"}, [900020523](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020523){:target="_blank"}, [900020371](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020371){:target="_blank"}, and [900020409](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=900020409){:target="_blank"} are in the online catalog so far).

The miscellanies reveal rich sites of information about 17th- and 18th-century French musical culture, and are therefore especially deserving of comprehensive records on RISM. The miscellanies with which I have worked represent a musical book culture in which operatic pieces mixed with _chansons à boire_ and other genres. Several miscellanies were each contributed to by multiple copyists over periods that spanned up to eight decades. Not all copyists recorded the title and other identifying information with the pieces they inscribed. To identify the anonymity of these works, I entered their incipits into RISM using [Plaine & Easie Code](http://www.iaml.info/plaine-easie-code){:target="_blank"}. Using this method, I have identified nearly 50 anonymous works from several miscellanies in the Ward Collection. The detailed records of these volumes should prove useful to scholars interested in documenting the role of manuscript miscellanies in Baroque musical culture.
