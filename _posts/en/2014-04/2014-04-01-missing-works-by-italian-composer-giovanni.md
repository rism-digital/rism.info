In the attic of the archives of the Ospedale Wolf-Ferrari in Messina, Italy (I-MEow), a collection of important works by the relatively unknown Italian composer Giovanni Francesco Bicchini (_d._ 1585) was recently discovered by RISM catalogers working in the area. Our view of this composer, previously known only through his music for two voices, will radically change.

Of particular significance is a motet for 40 cats, which has survived almost completely intact. It has now been cataloged in the [RISM online catalog](/resources-old-website/community-content/Zentralredaktion/Bicchini_-_englisch.PNG) (_click to enlarge_). Further research has uncovered that the famous Italian poet [Francesco Petrarca](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Francesco+Petrarca){:target="_blank"} (1304-1374) wrote the text. On the title page of one of the soprano parts is a note about the piece's first performance--"il primo aprile 1580"-- exactly 434 years ago today. A list of the performers at the premiere has also been preserved on a scrap of paper that was found among the documents. It also appears that a painter was in the audience to immortalize three of the soloists; this is likely from the closing section of the piece's first part (picture, above left). The significance of the mouse is unknown.

Judging from the incipits, there is no doubt that Gioachino Rossini used this motet as the basis for his "[Duetto buffo di due gatti](http://opac.rism.info/search?documentid=455026159){:target="_blank"}" of 1825. Italian scholar Filippi Stegosti is preparing a detailed analysis and will soon announce his findings in the Italian press.

With the recording below, you can judge for yourself.
