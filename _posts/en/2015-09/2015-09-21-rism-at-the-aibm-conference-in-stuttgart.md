The [AIBM annual conference](http://www.aibm.info/tagungen/2015-stuttgart/){:target="_blank"} (German branch of [IAML](http://www.iaml.info/){:target="_blank"}) is right around the corner: from September 22 to 25, around 160 participants will come together from Germany and neighboring German-speaking countries to discuss the current situation of music libraries and their future. Sessions of interest to public as well as academic libraries are on the agenda. The presentations and workshops will touch on themes such as digitization projects, strategies for an inclusive atmosphere for seniors and refugees, copyright, and the implementation of RDA.

On September 24, Martina Falletta and Jennifer Ward of the RISM Central Office will be looking forward to giving an overview of the recent RISM user study and sharing the initial results and their implications.

An attractive cultural program will round off the conference, including a tour through the new [Stuttgart Municipal Library](http://www1.stuttgart.de/stadtbibliothek/){:target="_blank"} and the [Stuttgart Opera](http://www.oper-stuttgart.de/ "external-link-new-window").
