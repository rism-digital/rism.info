Italian opera of the 19th century presented new challenges for singers, especially for coloratura sopranos. Eugenia Tadolini (1808-1872) delighted the public as well as numerous composers throughout her over twenty-year career. Atypically for a coloratura soprano, she refrained from adding her own coloratura passages, such as in the role of Amina in Bellini's _La Somnambula_. But it was precisely the beauty of her voice that prevented her from singing the role of Lady Macbeth in the 1848 premiere of Verdi's _Macbeth_; the composer had in mind more of a harsh, stifled, and hollow voice with a diabolical character.   
  
Nevertheless, Tadolini's name remains associated with numerous premieres, including Adina in Donizetti's _L'elisir dâ€™amore_, the main role in his _Linda di Chamounix_, and the title role in Verdi's _Alzira_.   
  
In RISM, [Eugenia Tadolini appears in only 16 records](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Tadolini+Eugenia) because names of singers are only included when they are named on the source.   
  
[A particularly nice manuscript](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=450065335&View=rism) contains four opera arias from Tadolini's repertoire of pieces that she sang at the Teatro S Carlo in Naples from 1843 to 1845.&nbsp;
