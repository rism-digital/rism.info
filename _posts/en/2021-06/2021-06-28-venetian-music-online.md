The project [Venetian Music Online](http://vmo.unive.it/){:blank} began in 2016, sponsored by the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. The project focuses on "research on music in Venice and its historical territories, and the history of Venetian musical culture in its European dimension."  

Results from the project will be published in the series “Venetian Music Studies” from Brepols as well in various online formats. This includes studies, critical editions, database, and other digital materials (audio, video, etc.).  

The online publication [The Sound of St Mark's. A Digital Catalogue of the Choirbooks with Polyphonic Music of the Venetian Ducal Chapel](http://vmo.unive.it/choirbooks/choirbooks){:blank}, published by Luigi Collarile and David Bryant, presents a digital catalog of 18 choirbooks. The repertoire in these choirbooks—masses, requiems, magnificats, hymns, and motets—can be found through indexes for composers, compositions, copyists, and watermarks. In 2014, the choirbooks with polyphonic music from the ducal chapel of Venice were declared UNESCO World Heritage. A detailed introduction to the music collection of the ducal chapel [can be found here](http://vmo.unive.it/choirbooks/historical_introduction){:blank}.  

The second online publication is by Luigi Collarile and entitled [Marchio Angeli’s Inventory (1720). The Music Books of the Ducal Chapel of St. Mark's, Venice](http://vmo.unive.it/inventory1720/){:blank}, which is preserved today in the Archivio di Stato in Venice. This is the oldest source that describes music collection of the ducal chapel. Indexes are provided here as well for research.
