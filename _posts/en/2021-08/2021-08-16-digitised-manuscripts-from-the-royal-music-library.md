_The following was originally published on the [Music Blog of the British Library](https://blogs.bl.uk/music/2021/08/digitised-manuscripts-from-the-royal-music-library.html){:blank} ([Creative Commons Attribution Licence](https://blogs.bl.uk/music/about-this-blog.html){:blank}):_  

In the last year we digitised nearly 40 manuscript volumes from the [Royal Music Library](https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/royal-music-library?_ga=2.169877216.1932010587.1628155098-597382534.1614276540){:blank}, including autographs by Agostino Steffani, J.C. Bach, Alessandro Scarlatti, and other composers.  

Among the manuscripts digitised are 24 volumes with works by Agostino Steffani (1654-1728), who served as _Kapellmeister_ and diplomat at the court of Duke Ernst August of Hanover from 1688 until 1703. The manuscripts in the Royal Music Library, some of which are in his own hand, are thought to have been brought from Hanover to England by King George I. They include numerous volumes with Steffani's chamber duets and operas, which survive in their original bindings.

Alongside the [digitised autograph Handel manuscripts](https://blogs.bl.uk/music/2016/07/can-you-handle-our-handel.html){:blank} in the Royal Music Library, the digitisation of these volumes is helping to highlight examples of well-represented composers in this collection and their autograph manuscripts, and also preserve manuscripts that survive in their original, and quite often fragile bindings.
