Has your institution undertaken a digitization project in recent years? Are the digital surrogates linked to their corresponding RISM records? 

[The RISM Catalog of Musical Sources](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=*){:blank} offers around 75,000 links to digitized sources: autograph manuscripts, full scores, manuscript parts, first editions, libretti, treatises, and more from all around the world. With just a click from either the catalog's filters or directly in the RISM record, our users have instant access to these valuable sources at their fingertips.  

Current RISM contributors add links to digital objects in the course of cataloging, but there are thousands of older records without links. Help us add links to RISM records and broaden exposure to your institution's holdings! 

To check if your digital surrogates are already linked, start an [Advanced Search](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism&SearchType=2&Language=en){:target="_blank"}, select the field **Library siglum**, and enter your institution's siglum. (To find the siglum, search the [Sigla Database](/community/sigla.html). If there are digital scans linked in the records, you will find a link in the filters under **Narrow results**, then **Digitized sources**).

If RISM hasn't linked to your scans yet, send us an Excel spreadsheet of RISM numbers with a permalink to the digital copy. The permalink can be either a direct link to the scan or a link to the bibliographic record that contains a link to the scan. The spreadsheet should be structured like this:

| RISM ID number | Permalink |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 190023469   | http://www2.musik.uu.se/duben/presentationWork.php?Select_Dnr=1096&Select_Wnr=814 |
| 290002576   | http://digital.slub-dresden.de/id435400657 |
| 550509317   | http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/index.php?direct=record&pid=rep_remake31 |
| 900005489   | http://juilliardmanuscriptcollection.org/manuscript/siegfried-idyll |
| 990000383 | http://www.bibliotecamusica.it/cmbm/scripts/gaspari/scheda.asp?id=7078 | 
| 993103826 | http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/307092 |  

The RISM catalog contains music manuscripts (all time periods), printed editions (generally up to around 1850), libretti, and treatises. This corresponds to series [A/II](/publications.html#series-a-inventories-of-musical-sources) for music manuscripts, [A/I](/publications.html#series-a-inventories-of-musical-sources) for printed editions with a single author, and [B/I](/publications.html#series-b-bibliographies-organized-by-topic) for printed anthologies. Many more sources not included in those series can also be found in the online catalog.

We are planning to add B/II (printed editions through the eighteenth century) to the online catalog in the near future, so if you wish you can send us links to those items as well, but in a separate spreadsheet.

Items from B/II do not have unique reference numbers. For these, please indicate the title, page number, and permalink:

| Title | Page number in B/II | Permalink |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Recueil d'Airs sérieux et à boire de différents auteurs ; pour l'année 1713   | 313 | http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k856381j# |

Links are accepted on an ongoing basis. Please send your spreadsheet(s) to: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info)

If you need any assistance, please let us know and we are happy to help.
