Last year, in the music archive at Wilhering Abbey, Dr. Ikarus Kaiser of the Austrian Academy of Sciences discovered the only known copy of a mass by the Baroque composer Franz Anton Ertl, who was active around Linz, Austria ([RISM ID no. 600077182](http://opac.rism.info/search?documentid=600077182){:target="_blank"}).This coming Sunday, November 24 at 10 AM (Feast of Christ the King), the work will be performed during High Mass at Wilhering by musicians of the abbey. It will be under the direction of Kurt Azesberger with Dr. Kaiser at the organ.
