The annual congress of the [International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres (IAML)](https://www.iaml.info/) will be held for the first time online this year, from 26-30 July 2021. An advantage of the online environment is that the congress will be more accessible to people around the world and registration is free for all. The full program and registration information is available [on the congress website](https://www.iaml.info/congresses/2021-online).  

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of IAML. The opening session on Monday, July 26, will celebrate this milestone and include reflections on [the four R Projects](http://www.r-musicprojects.org/), the four music bibliographic tools RISM, RILM, RIdIM, and RIPM.  

The main RISM session, also on the Monday, will feature news from Bal√°zs Mikusi (Executive Director of the RISM Editorial Center, Frankfurt am Main), a report on planned developments with the [RISM online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4) from Bernhard Lutz (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich), and an introduction to the new [RISM Digital Center](https://rism.digital/) and a preview of the RISM Online platform by Laurent Pugin and Andrew Hankinson (RISM Digital Center, Bern).  

Two paper sessions on Thursday, July 29, will include papers by RISM contributors from our working groups in the Chinese-Language Region, Greece, and the United States. Bin Han and YuanYuan Zhang will talk about Chinese music manuscripts collections, Arsinoi Ioannidou, Maria Aslanidi, and Aris Bazmadelis will throw the spotlight on Byzantine music-related authority metadata in [Muscat](/community/muscat.html), and Emerson Morgan and Christina Linklater will discuss issues arising when cataloging a score from India.  

This year one of the two North America Regional Meetings will call attention to recent RISM projects on the continent. On Friday, July 30, the work of our RISM contributors John G. Lazos ([sources in Mexico](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=MEX-*)), Katie Buehner and Hang Nguyen ([sources at the University of Iowa](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=US-IO)), and David Walter Floyd ([sources at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=US-U)) will be highlighted in a session that shows the importance of local and national contributions to RISM. Registration for this special regional meeting is available [through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfr5fUbTYbku5ns-j2h_bbk5Aaf3vlfg5T6Chv6qyTH87vaVA/viewform).
