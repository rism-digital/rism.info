**Happy New Year!** 

As in past years, we are using the beginning of the year to look at significant anniversaries of birth or death for people found in RISM. We are listing not only our RISM composers, but also librettists, performers, dedicatees, or other people who are connected to a musical source in any way. They were born or died in a year that ends in 26 or 76. 

[Our Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NA293dTnL9lGvlvUmVfOAXNCrz6GcXSZd1nbVPqu_P4/edit?usp=sharing){:blank} is divided into two sheets, one for year of birth and one for year of death. You can sort by name, life dates, or gender, and we’re also including direct links to RISM Online and the RISM Catalog.
