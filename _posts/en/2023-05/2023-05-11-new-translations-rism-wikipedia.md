[The article about RISM on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9pertoire_International_des_Sources_Musicales){:blank} is now available in 16 languages, five more than [when we last reported in 2019](/new_publications/2019/10/10/risms-wikipedia-articles-now-updated.html).  

The new languages are [Farsi](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA_%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%84%DB%8C_%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9_%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%82%DB%8C){:blank}, [Greek](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94%CE%B9%CE%B5%CE%B8%CE%BD%CE%AD%CF%82_%CE%95%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%9C%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD_%CE%A0%CE%B7%CE%B3%CF%8E%CE%BD){:blank}, [Hungarian](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9pertoire_International_des_Sources_Musicales){:blank}, [Polish](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9pertoire_International_des_Sources_Musicales){:blank}, and [Slovenian](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9pertoire_International_des_Sources_Musicales){:blank}. Thank you to our colleagues and the anonymous translators who wrote these! The five new languages join Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. We encourage speakers of these languages to update the respective articles, and it would also be wonderful to have the article about RISM available in other languages as well.  

The Wikipedia articles are important sources of information about RISM for readers around the world. Having a presence on Wikipedia is especially important for the languages that are not included on the RISM website, which is currently only in English and German, with some in French. For an international project, it is vital that we reach people around the world in their native languages.  

The Wikipedia articles are read often, as well. In 2022, the RISM articles were read [nearly 6,000 times](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/langviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&start=2022-05-10&end=2023-05-10&sort=views&direction=1&view=list&page=R%C3%A9pertoire%20International%20des%20Sources%20Musicales){:blank}.
