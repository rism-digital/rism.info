RISM is pleased to announce that the brochure "RISM: An Overview" is now available in an English-Spanish version entitled "RISM: Presentación general." It can be downloaded [from the RISM website](/publications/brochures.html).

If you want professionally printed copies of the brochure, also at no charge, please contact us: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info). Let us know how many you want. Feel free to request some copies to share with your colleagues, other staff or faculty members, and students.

We would like to thank RISM contributor John Lazos for translating the brochure into Spanish.

"RISM: Presentación general" joins RISM brochures available in English, German, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Russian. A brochure in Portuguese will be available next year.
