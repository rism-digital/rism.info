In 2017, on the occasion of [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About){:blank}, we published a spreadsheet of [all women composers found in RISM](/events/2017/03/08/international-womens-day-women-composers-in.html).  

Over the past four years, this number has grown from ca. 800 to over 1,000. That was more than enough reason for us to publish [this new spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H1I4C5Fkww-EbPhK3_1XpZk6I1FxYFEFIGDjm-S3hXk/edit?usp=sharing){:blank}.  

In addition, new findings were also incorporated, such as the fact that the initials "A. von K." stand for Agnes von Knobloch.  

Instead of indicating the number of sources in RISM, we offer you a direct link to the sources in the online catalog.
