The newest issue of [_Fontes Artis Musicae_](https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/43682){:blank} caught our eye because it contains reviews of two recent publications involving our [RISM Salzburg working group](http://salzburg.rism.info/home.html).  

* _Dommusikarchiv Salzburg (A-Sd). Thematischer Katalog der musikalischen Quellen, Reihe A_. Edited by Eva Neumayr and Lars E. Laubhold with Ernst Hintermaier, RISM Arbeitsgruppe Salzburg. Vienna: [Hollitzer Verlag](http://www.hollitzer.at/buch/dommusikarchiv-salzburg-a-sd-thematischer-katalog-der-musikalischen-quellen-reihe-a/){:blank}, 2018.  

* _Musik am Dom zu Salzburg. Repertoire und liturgisch gebundene Praxis zwischen Hochbarocker Repr√§sentation und Mozart-Kult_. By Eva Neumayr, Lars E. Laubhold, and Ernst Hintermaier. Vienna: [Hollitzer Verlag](http://www.hollitzer.at/buch/musik-am-dom-zu-salzburg/){:blank}, 2018.  

Now, both books are available online for free through the FWF E-Book Library.  

[The catalog](https://e-book.fwf.ac.at/o:1205){:blank}, which [we announced when it was published](/new_publications/2018/07/19/musical-sources-in-the-salzburg-cathedral-archive.html), focuses on the music of the Salzburg Cathedral, [cataloged in RISM as A-Sd](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&siglum=A-Sd){:blank}. In _Fontes_ it was praised as being "a significant documentation of the church music played in one of the most powerful and culturally important institutions in Central Europe during the Baroque era and beyond." This catalog, we would like to point out, was created using the RISM records as a basis.  

The book [_Musik am Dom zu Salzburg_](https://e-book.fwf.ac.at/o:1232){:blank} supplements the thematic catalog with a first-time overview of the musical practice reflected in the collection from the late 17th to the early 19th centuries, taking into account aspects related to liturgy and performance practice but also the history of the collection itself. A "must-have" (according to _Fontes_) for examining the local music tradition of a very important musical city.  

Expert cataloging of the sources now makes it possible to have a new foundation on which to build our knowledge of music at the Salzburg Cathedral.
