The RISM Central Office is carrying out a survey about our online catalog, which is available free of charge at [www.rism.info](http://www.rism.info/) and [opac.rism.info](http://opac.rism.info/){:target="_blank"}.


We would like to find out who our users are, what their expectations are, and how they use the catalog. The survey is anonymous and responses will help us as we continue to develop our services and the online catalog.


You can access the survey at: [http://goo.gl/forms/p40bcrZcJI](http://goo.gl/forms/p40bcrZcJI)


It will remain open through January 18, 2015.


Please share this message with other groups that may have an interest in RISM: antiquarian dealers, archivists, librarians, musicians, musicologists, professors, students. We especially need your help getting the word out to organizations in other countries.


Printer-friendly versions of this announcement for you to hang up or distribute at your institution may be downloaded at: [http://www.rism.info/community/survey.html](/community/survey.html)


The survey is also available in German: [http://goo.gl/forms/02VLj4tSEj](http://goo.gl/forms/02VLj4tSEj)
