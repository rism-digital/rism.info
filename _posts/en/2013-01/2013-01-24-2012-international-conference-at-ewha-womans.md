The Music Research Institute at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea organized an international conference from 19-20 October 2012. The title of the conference was “The Discovery of Modernity in East Asian Music: The West, Tradition, and Beyond.” The conference consisted of five parts:

Part 1: Keeping the Past Alive: Digitization of Primary Resources

Part 2: Modernity and the West

Part 3: Modernity and Tradition

Part 4: Modernity and Popularity

Part 5: Asian Modernity and Rewriting Global Music History

Jennifer Ward from the RISM Zentralredaktion was among the renowned musicologists from different countries (Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Germany, USA). She presented a paper entitled "The Repertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM): Using Sources to Understand the Past." It was a successful conference that resonated with the audience. Significantly, this was the first time that experts working worldwide on the topic of musical modernity in Asia came together in a discussion forum and constructed new perspectives on modernity in East Asia. The work that has been carried out by the RISM Working Group at the Ewha Music Research Institute was also presented.
