During the month of April, [Dr. John Lazos](/international/working-groups.html) is spending his time between research at various Mexican archives and giving a seminar at the Faculty of Music of the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](http://www.fam.unam.mx/){:target="_blank"}. Dr. Lazos has been awarded a bursary from the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (FONCA) for a project that entails cataloguing music manuscripts by José Antonio Gómez y Olguín (1805-1876). Gómez’s manuscripts will be updated shortly in RISM’s database. Currently there are [29 sources by Gómez](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&author=gomez+y+olguin){:target="_blank"} in the RISM database, all cataloged by Dr. Lazos in the course of earlier projects.
