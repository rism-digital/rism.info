Tomorrow, the first Friday in May, is International Tuba Day! This day recognizes "tubists in musical organizations around the world who have to go through the hassle of handling a tuba," according to the [official website](http://www.tubaday.com/homepage.php){:target="_blank"}.

One of the most famous works for tuba is Ralph Vaughan Williams's Concerto for Tuba and Orchestra in F minor. Composers have also paired our lowest wind instrument with our highest. R. Winston Morris and Daniel Perantoni's [_Guide to the Tuba Repertoire_](https://books.google.de/books?id=hzNAMFpMvQ0C&lpg=PA204&ots=4cCUzwzRVY&dq=music%20for%20%20%22piccolo%20and%20tuba%22&hl=de&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q=%22piccolo%20and%20tuba%22&f=false){:target="_blank"} lists five pieces for tuba and piccolo.

What does a tuba look like if you stretch it out completely? Like the [picture](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tubajuri_2004.jpg?uselang=de){:target="_blank"} in the upper corner! This instrument, built in 1913, is in the [Museum of Musical Instruments](http://www.museum-markneukirchen.de/){:target="_blank"} in Markneukirchen, Germany. It is playable but mostly used in parades today.

To find music for tuba in the RISM [online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism){:target="_blank"}, use an **Advanced search** and select the field **All fields**. Enter the RISM abbreviation, **tb**. This will retrieve the over [2,000 sources](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=tb "external-link-new-window") with a tuba. Use the filters on the left to narrow your search.

A note for advanced RISM users: If you search the field **Scoring** for tb, you will retrieve results where the tuba is listed in the **Scoring summary**. These works tend to be smaller ensemble pieces, and you only get 21 results. Searching in **All fields** is a more effective way of getting music for a particular instrument. We are aware that this situation isn't ideal, and we hope to find a better solution.

There are links to over 50 digitized scores with tuba in the online catalog, including works by Brahms, Dvořák, Rubinstein, Sibelius, and Wagner.

Happy Tuba Day!
