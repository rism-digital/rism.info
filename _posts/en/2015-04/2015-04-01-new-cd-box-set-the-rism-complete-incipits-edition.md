Many people know that one of the things that makes RISM unique is that we include music incipits in our records.

How many times have you thought to yourself, "If only I could listen to these music incipits all day!"

Now you can! Announcing a new CD box set, the **RISM Complete Incipits Edition** (image, left). Available on 2,286 CDs, this limited edition box set includes 1,690,822 incipits performed on historically accurate instruments.

Who can forget the classic opening to [Anton Diabelli's _Tantum Ego_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=600245067){:target="_blank"}?
