The cities of [Paphos, Cyprus](http://www.pafos2017.eu/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} and [Aarhus, Denmark](http://www.aarhus2017.dk/en/){:target="_blank"} are the two European Capitals of Culture in 2017.

Paphos is located in the southwest corner of Cyprus and offers visitors countless ancient treasures. Among these are magnificent mosaic floors from Roman times and the Temple of Aphrodite in Old Paphos. Unfortunately we don't yet have any musical sources from Paphos or Cyprus in RISM, but somewhere there's bound to be some unimagined treasures waiting to be roused from their slumber…

The university city of Aarhus is the second-largest city in Denmark and one of the oldest Nordic cities. It was founded by the Vikings more than 1,200 years ago.

The motto of Aarhus 2017 is **[Let's rethink](http://www.aarhus2017.dk/en/about-us/what-is-aarhus-2017/lets-rethink/){:target="_blank"}** and incorporates a new approach to thinking that is "a mindset for change, innovation and courage, a progressive way of thinking and acting smarter." A goal is to look for "new practices, new ways of forming partnerships, new business models and new concepts of growth" to transform the Central Denmark Region into a cultural laboratory.

The [Statsbiblioteket](http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/){:target="_blank"} in Aarhus (which merged with the Royal Library in Copenhagen this January) has [516 entries in the RISM online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/search?View=rism&siglum=DK-A){:target="_blank"} (DK-A), mostly printed music from series A/I. The manuscripts and prints offer a colorful cross section through music history in the eighteenth century. Among the manuscripts are some works in Danish translation, such as a few cantatas by Georg Philipp Telemanns from the _Engel-Jahrgang_ cycle and Joseph Haydn's cantata _[Der Sturm](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=150203362){:target="_blank"}_. Some prints (ca. 20) have digitized copies that can be viewed online.
