As in previous years, various organizations have made selections for a plant or animal "of the year" for 2022. The [German environmental organization NABU](https://www.nabu.de/tiere-und-pflanzen/aktionen-und-projekte/natur-des-jahres/2022.html){:blank} has a good overview. Apart from this list, the non-profit organization Bündnis Mensch & Tier has picked the donkey as the [domestic animal of the year](https://www.buendnis-mensch-und-tier.de/haustier-des-jahres/2022-der-esel/){:blank}.   

Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, sometimes even dumb, and the word is often used as an insult. And as you might expect, these good-natured, attentive, and calm animals can also be found in the RISM catalog in various languages: Esel, donkey, l'asino, l'âne, osioł.  

In German, the _Esel_ ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=Esel){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/search?q=esel&mode=sources&page=1&rows=20){:blank}) has a fixed place in numerous songs, especially children's songs. But film music by Martin Böttcher (1927-2019) from the German movie _13 kleine Esel und der Sonnenhof_ ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001083217&View=rism){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/sources/1001083217){:blank}) from 1958 has found its way into the database.  

To find donkeys in French, in the RISM Catalog you can do an [**Advanced search**](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism&SearchType=2&Language=en){:blank} for _âne_ in **All Fields** and select **Language**, then enter **French**.  In [RISM Online](https://rism.online/search?q=%C3%A2ne&mode=sources&fq=text-language%3Afre&page=1&rows=20){:blank} you can search for _âne_ on the **Sources** page and then under **Source contents** you can select **French** under **Language of text**.  

A Polish version can be found in the Christmas song "O bożym narodzeniu" by Józef Stefani (1800-1876) ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=1001119957&View=rism){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/sources/1001119957){:blank}) with the words “Wół ryczy osioł krzyczy wrona skrzeczy baranek beczy” (The ox lows, the donkey brays, the crow caws, the lamb bleats).

Among the English-language versions ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=donkey){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/search?q=donkey&mode=sources&page=1&rows=20){:blank}), one record stands out.  Who know the dance steps to the  _Donkey waltz_ (RISM ID no. 125415; [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=125415&View=rism){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/sources/125415){:blank})?    

In Italian-language musical sources, the donkey ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?View=rism&q=asino){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/search?q=asino&mode=sources&page=1&rows=20){:blank}) can be found in many operatic settings. Take, as an example, a two-act opera by Valentino Fioravanti (1764-1837) that is completely unknown today, _Il Ciabattino incivilito_ ([RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=270001503&View=rism){:blank}\|[RISM Online](https://rism.online/sources/270001503){:blank}). In scene 6 of the second act (see incipit 1.37.1), there is a duet between Melibeo and Sciabacchino, who vent about the poor shoemaker who lacks will (“Come un asino è restato li gelato poverino s'è scoperto ciabattino senza averne volontà”).
