# RISM Belgium - Brussels office

The Brussels office of RISM Belgium deals with the Royal Library of Belgium musical sources.

The majority of its music manuscripts were described in the RISM A/II between 1993 and 1998. New acquisitions (such asmanuscripts by Henry Vieuxtemps and Eugène Ysaÿe) or previously neglected or unknown prints, copies or manuscripts sources are regularly added to the new RISM database.

Created in 1965, the [Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium](http://www.kbr.be/collections/musique/musique_fr.html) is the most important research center in the country for the preservation and study of music-related documents. The Music Division holds hundreds of thousands manuscript and printed scores, about 100,000 sound recordings, large collections of musicians’ letters, concert programs and posters, photographs and other iconographic materials, and finally some 800 music-related objects such as medals, paintings, sculptures, music instruments.

Its initial core is represented by the music library of Belgian musicologist François-Joseph Fétis, one of the richest collections of early music of the 19th century (including notably an autograph of J.S. Bach). It then expanded into a musicological reference library unique in Belgium, thanks to an active acquisition policy and to a number of music collections - from the 18th century until today - linked to personalities or institutions involved in Belgian and international musical life, such as Bela Bartók, César Franck, André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry, Franz Liszt, Albert Roussel, Henry Vieuxtemps, Guillaume Lekeu, Eugène Ysaÿe.

The team of the RISM Brussels office is composed of:

- Dr Marie Cornaz, musicologist, curator of the Music Division and lecturer in musicology at the [Brussels University](http://philoscsoc.ulb.be/hist/fr/users/mcornaz){:blank}; she is one of the members of the Coordinating Committee of the RISM Advisory Council

- [Kris De Baerdemacker](/en/workgroups/belgium-brussels-royal-library-of-belgium/home.html), musician and composer; he encodes new descriptions of musical sources kept in the Royal Library of Belgium and corrects existing descriptions

- Patrizia Rebulla ([patrizia.rebulla@kbr.be](mailto:patrizia.rebulla@kbr.be)) edits the list of libraries and posts new items.
