The catalogue of the music sources of the Fondo Cappella Sistina in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana goes back to the research project "Cappella Sistina" under the direction of Ludwig Finscher, funded by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences between 1989 and 2001. One of the main objectives of this project was the preparation of a catalogue raisonée of the Fondo, setting new codicological standards. Following preparatory work by Adalbert Roth and Bernhard Janz, the substantive work on this catalogue took place between 1995 and 2002 by Thomas Schmidt (manuscripts) and Gottfried Heinz (printed editions), with a planned book publication in the catalogue series of the Vatican library. However, due to the end of the project’s funding and changes in personnel, this publication is yet to see the light of day. It is therefore all the more gratifying that the bulk of the catalogue data is now finally publicly accessible in the context of the RISM online catalogue. It is a source of great sadness that the spiritus rector of the project, Ludwig Finscher, did not live to see this happen as the non-completion of the Cappella Sistina project was always a source of great regret to him; he passed away on 30 June 2020.
