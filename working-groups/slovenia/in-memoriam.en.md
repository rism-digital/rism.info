Darja began working for RISM in 1998. She attended the conference "Academic and Technical Challenges of Musicological Source Research in an International Framework" on the occasion of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of RISM in 2002. We saw her at the Zentralredaktion for the last time in spring 2007 at a workshop on Kallisto.

We have lost an excellent cataloguer and a dear friend.

We will always remember her.
