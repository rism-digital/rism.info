# Ewha Womans University College of Music

The [Music Research Institute, College of Music at Ewha Womans University](http://my.ewha.ac.kr/musicieen/){:blank} in Seoul, South Korea has begun to document and build a database of musical sources from Korea and East Asia thanks to a state subsidy.

The research team (Director of Music Research Institute: Prof./Dr. Hyun Kyung Chae), through long investigations, has collected a vast quantity of sources in different formats: handwritten and printed music, writings about music and music theory, photos, recordings, and more.

Ever since Western music was introduced to South Korea at the end of the 19th century, both Western-oriented music and traditional Korean music have been represented in the musical culture of the country as two independent categories.

An extensive documentation system with digital archiving will therefore be developed.
