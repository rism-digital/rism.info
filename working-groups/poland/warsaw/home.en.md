# In memoriam Elzbieta Wojnowska

 ![](/resources-old-website/workgroups-images/csm_Wojnowska_a745b05706.jpg "Wojnowska")

Elzbieta Wojnowska had led, together with Jolanta Byczkowska-Sztaba, the Polish Center of RISM at the National Library in Warsaw since ca. 1984. During that time, she made RISM known in Poland and left her mark on it.

She often participated in RISM events, be it at the IAML conferences or lastly at the 2002 conference for the 50th anniversary of RISM in Frankfurt. Here she contributed an interesting paper about music collections that had been dispersed during the Second World War.

She had been suffering from a long illness, against which she fought with her great energy. Her struggle is now over.

We would like to extend our deepest sympathy to her family.

She will always remain in our memories and admiration.
