# Welcome to the RISM Community!

The RISM database is used by researchers, musicians, librarians, students, music antiquarians, and our active contributors worldwide as a foundation for their work and to contribute new knowledge about the musical past. We have assembled some resources here to enable the wider RISM community to use our tools effectively.
