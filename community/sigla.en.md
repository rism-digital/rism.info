# Online Directory of RISM Library Sigla

RISM assigns an abbreviation, called a library siglum, to institutions worldwide that hold musical sources or material related to the research of music. Currently there are about 8,500 sigla in RISM. A gold star appears next to the institutions that have sources in the [RISM Catalog of Musical Sources](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4){:blank}.

If you are looking for a siglum that is not yet in the directory, [please contact us](mailto:contact@rism.info) and we will create a new one.
