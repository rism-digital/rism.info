RISM contributors, musicologists, librarians, archivists, researchers: Share your news with RISM! 

[The RISM blog](/news-archive/all/) regularly features posts that showcase all aspects of musical sources: 
* [rediscoveries](/news-archive/rediscovered/)
* new insights
* current projects
* [new publications](/news-archive/new_publications/)
* concerts featuring sources in RISM
* posts on instruments or repertoire
* [newly digitized sources or new digital resources](/news-archive/electronic_resources/)
* insights into a composer/dedicatee/copyist/etc.
* spotlight on a source
* announcements  

and more. [Musical anniversaries](/news-archive/musical_anniversaries/) are also a good way to tie RISM into current events. 

We are also happy to post articles that have been published elsewhere, such as blog posts at your institutions, or text that you have used for other purposes.  

If you have anything to share with the wider RISM community, please let us know. Please observe the following:
* Length: typically a half page to a full page, but can be longer.
* Please include an image with a photo credit.
* Write in English, German, or French, or a different language as long as a translation is included in one of those three.

Please contact us if you have a proposal or if you want to discuss this further: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info)
