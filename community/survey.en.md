# The RISM survey

The RISM Central Office carried out a survey about the online catalog from October 30, 2014 to February 28, 2015 (view the [survey questions](/resources/community/survey/RISM_User_Survey_-_Google_Formulare.pdf) here). In total, 551 valid responses were received, 342 in English and 209 in German. The survey was part of a larger, year-long user study that examined how people interact with the online catalog.

Please contact us with any questions you might have: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info).
