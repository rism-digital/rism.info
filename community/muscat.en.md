Muscat is RISM's central cataloging program for musical sources (manuscripts, printed music, libretti, and treatises). It is developed as an open-source project by the RISM under the leadership of the [RISM Digital Center](https://rism.digital){:target="_blank"} and in close collaboration with the Editorial Center and the working groups. For more information about the project, its philosophy and its history, visit the [Muscat Project](http://muscat-project.org/history.html){:target="_blank"} website.

## About Muscat

As of December 2020, Muscat contains in total 1,484,000 musical sources, 139,000 authority records for personal names, 59,000 institutions, and 36,000 records for secondary literature. Muscat includes sources from the RISM series A/I, A/II, and B/I, as well as sources outside these series. 

Muscat is a multilingual, [open source](https://github.com/rism-ch/muscat){:target="_blank"}, web-based, platform-independent program. It uses MARC21 and thus has an internationally widespread and standardized data model at its core. Additional features include:
* Built-in version control to identify changes
* Ability to leave comments for sources and authority files
* Intuitive management of digital objects
* Ability to create folders to organize work
* Link to VIAF to import personal name authority records
* Custom-built module to display incipits
* Expanded ability to add guidelines in different languages
* Integrated full online catalog search with geovisualizations
* Interfaces in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish, with a translations in Korean in preparation
