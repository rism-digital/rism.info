# RISM for Researchers  

RISM has long been the cornerstone of musicological projects. The following pages will help you if you are using RISM for research, scholarship, university projects, or data analysis.  

## Guides  

- [How to Cite RISM](/community/how-to-cite-rism.html): RISM’s recommendations for citing music manuscripts and printed editions in publications.    
- [Finding Unica in the RISM Database](/community/finding-unica-in-rism.html): Find out how to find printed editions that are held by only one institution in the RISM database.  
- [How to use RISM Library Sigla](/community/sigla/about.html): Explanation of RISM’s abbreviations for libraries, archives and collections with historical music holdings

## Research projects  

RISM can serve as a partner in research projects on a small or large scale. The extensive pool of RISM data can launch research from a variety of starting points, such as by composer, repertoire, genre, time period, geographic area, or material type. When partnering with RISM, project participants have direct access to our database and cataloging program. There is therefore no need to develop separate cataloging systems or databases. Records are published in the international RISM database, and data can be extracted for use elsewhere.  

### Collaborating with RISM  

Read the following reports for examples of various collaborations with RISM:  
- McGill University: [Mapping the Musical Landscape of the Sixteenth Century (MML16)](/in_the_news/2019/07/29/mapping-the-musical-landscape-of-the-sixteenth.html)   
- Music, Heritage, Place: Unlocking the Musical Collections of England’s County Record Offices [Part 1](/library_collections/2024/09/26/music-from-english-local-archives-in-rism.html), [Part 2](/library_collections/2024/10/04/musical-discoveries-from-english-local-archives.html)   
- The Library of Congress's Junior Fellows program: [Enhancing Visibility of American Music Manuscripts at the Library of Congress](/library_collections/2024/02/08/library-of-congress-summer-report.html)

Researchers focusing on music by a particular composer or preserved at a certain institution can catalog the music in RISM, ensuring that the musical sources can be explored by an international audience. The RISM records can be referenced in university theses and publications, or published as separate catalogs. Here are some examples:  

-  [The ‘C Collection’ in the Music Archive of the Cathedrals of Zaragoza](/new_publications/2023/08/17/discovering-new-music-collections.html), by Carmen Álvarez-Escandell
- [The "Periodico de musica" at the Biblioteca Nacional d’Andorra](/new_at_rism/2020/06/15/the-first-record-from-andorra-in-rism-the.html), by Joan Benavent Peiró  
- [The works of José Antonio Gómez y Olguín](/new_publications/2016/03/07/jos%C3%A9-antonio-g%C3%B3mez-y-olgu%C3%ADn-18051876-y-su-cat%C3%A1logo.html), by John G. Lazos  
- [The Archivio musicale Luca Moretti private collection](/library_collections/2023/06/01/the-archivio-musicale-luca-moretti-in-rism.html), by Luca Moretti  
- [The "Master Muñoz Pedrera" collection at the Municipal Archives of Murcia](/library_collections/2023/09/14/pedrera-collection-murcia.html), by Juan Francisco Murcia Galián   

A subset of RISM records can be gathered and printed as a separate catalog. Such catalogs may be needed for all sorts of reasons: to publish a printed catalog of the holdings of a collection, to provide funding agencies and sponsors with proof that a promised project was successfully completed, or simply to provide an overview of the records in the course of research. While the production of such a catalog requires some fluency in IT matters, musicologists and librarians who can draw on IT assistance at their home institutions can easily make use of this opportunity to present the results of their work outside of the main RISM online database. Instructions can be found on [our page Catalog Printouts of RISM Data](/community/catalog-printouts.html).

## Data sets  

The RISM records can be used in data analysis. The data can be accessed from the RISM Catalog's [Data page](https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/data){:blank} or by using the [RISM Online API](https://rism.online/docs/api/api/){:blank}.  

We have also published subsets of the data in spreadsheets that can be used for research. The links below are to our blog posts for context, and the spreadsheets can be downloaded from the posts.
