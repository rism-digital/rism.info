# Publications

The RISM publications represent RISM's activities that began in 1952 and continue to the present day. The [online catalog](#online-catalog) is the focus of RISM's current activities and is freely available online.

RISM's other publications are divided into series, reflecting the early structure of the project, though with the integration of much of the data into the online environment, the strict division into series plays a secondary role. [Series A](#series-a-inventories-of-musical-sources) documents musical sources in two parts: printed music containing works by one composer (A/I) and music manuscripts (A/II). [Series B](#series-b-bibliographies-organized-by-topic) is designed to cover specific categories of repertory. Series A and B are supplemented by [Series C](#series-c-directory-of-music-research-libraries), the Directory of Music Research Libraries. [Special volumes](#special-volumes) have also been published on the _Tenorlied_ and RISM library sigla (now available in the [Online Directory of RISM Library Sigal](/community/sigla.html)).

## Online Catalog

{% include image file="/images/publications/opac.png" pos="right" %}

The RISM Online Catalog is a free resource that can be accessed from [rism.info](https://rism.info) and [opac.rism.info](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=15&L=1){:target="_blank"}. It documents manuscripts, printed music, libretti, and treatises.

The online catalog contains all of series [A/I, A/II](#series-a-inventories-of-musical-sources), and years 1501-1550, 1601-1650, and most of 1651-1690 of [B/I](#series-b-bibliographies-organized-by-topic).

It is made possible through a partnership between the [Bavarian State Library](https://www.bsb-muenchen.de/ "https://www.bsb-muenchen.de/") (Munich), the [State Library of Berlin](http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/ "http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/"), and RISM. The Bavarian State Library is responsible for the operation and technical implementation of the RISM online catalog.
