# Publications

The RISM publications represent RISM's activities that began in 1952 and continue to the present day. The focus of RISM's current activities is its electronic database, which can be searched at no cost through two resources, the RISM Catalog and RISM Online. RISM's library sigla can be searched through the [Directory of RISM Library Sigla](/community/sigla.html).

## Search tools     
RISM's database of over 1.5 million records can be searched through two different but complementary resources, the RISM Catalog and RISM Online. The musical sources that stand at the heart of the RISM project are music manuscripts, printed music, libretti, and treatises preserved in over 3,000 libraries, museums, archives, churches, schools, and private collections around the world. Our online tools incorporate records from earlier series (all of A/I, all of A/II, all of B/I, some of B/II and other B volumes; for details, see below), but also expand well beyond our early publications. The database grows monthly and reflects the work of our active RISM contributors worldwide.

### RISM Catalog
{% include image file="/images/publications/opac.png"  %}  

The RISM Catalog can be accessed through the RISM homepage or from [opac.rism.info](https://opac.rism.info){:target="_blank"}. It is made possible through a partnership between the [Bavarian State Library](https://www.bsb-muenchen.de/ "https://www.bsb-muenchen.de/") (Munich), the [State Library of Berlin](http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/ "http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/"), and the RISM Editorial Center. The Bavarian State Library is responsible for the operation and technical implementation of the RISM Catalog.  

### RISM Online
{% include image file="/images/publications/rism-online-screenshot.jpg" %}

RISM Online can be accessed through the RISM homepage or from [rism.online](https://rism.online/){:blank}. It is developed by the [RISM Digital Center](/digital-center.html){:blank} in Bern, Switzerland. Besides the core RISM pool of sources, RISM Online also enables users to search the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM).

## Series A: Inventories of musical sources

{% include image file="/images/publications/books.jpg" pos="right" %}

All of Series A is available online through [RISM's electronic catalogs](/publications.html#rism-database). Items within the scope of A/I and A/II are added directly to the RISM database. The alphanumeric A/I identification numbers (for example, T 444) are searchable online but are not being continued for new records in RISM.

"Moreover, it relates the anonymous treatises in one or other manuscript to those other manuscripts in which the same--generally unpublished--treatise is found...The Index supplies a survey of the manuscripts in which this theoretical tradition is preserved, by providing a list of the authors' names and the incipits of the anonymous treatises."
