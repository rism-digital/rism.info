* [IMS](http://www.ims-online.ch/ "IMS") – International Musicological Society

## Commission Mixte

The Commission Mixte consists of ten members, five each from IAML and IMS. Together with the Board of the association, the Commission Mixte forms the executive committee that determines the strategic goals of the organization.

## Advisory Council

The Council consists of all active members of the different working groups in all countries.
