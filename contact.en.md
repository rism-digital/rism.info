# Contact RISM  

Please contact the RISM Editorial Center at [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info) with any questions, comments, or suggestions.

If you need a **RISM siglum** for an institution but you cannot find it in the [Directory of RISM Library Sigla](/community/sigla.html), we will create it for you.

Send us **feedback, additions, or corrections** to any record in the RISM database. If using our contact address above, make sure to include the ID number of the RISM record you are commenting on. Alternately, links to feedback forms are also available through any record:
- In the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info){:blank} on the left-hand side, "Send a comment on this record"   
- In [RISM Online](https://rism.online/){:blank} at the bottom, "Report an issue"
